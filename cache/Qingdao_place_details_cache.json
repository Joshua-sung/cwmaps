Because it has strong symbolism, many people want to take pictures here to commemorate their visit to Qingdao. Hoerangak itself is just a small two-story pavilion, but the surrounding scenery from here is spectacular. The wide sea, swimming beach, and forest of towering buildings come together to create a great backdrop for photos. However, you may not be able to get to Hoerangak due to the huge crowd, which may increase your discomfort level. Going up to the second floor is also a challenge.

It is a lonely eroded stone in the sea offshore, shaped like an old man who has gone through many hardships. Shilaoren can refer to an area in Qingdao. It is believed that the name comes from Shilaoren Stone. For tourists, it may be misleading to go to Stone Man. Shilaoren Beach and Shilaoren Tourist Park are not the ideal places to appreciate Shilaoren. How to get there: Take the bus and get off at the Shilaoren Station on Hong Kong East Road, turn back, turn into the branch road, and walk towards the seaside; when you arrive at the parking lot, go in, go to the seaside, and see the Shilaoren. On that day, fishing boats docked at the seaside, and Old Man Shi added a bit of the atmosphere of an old fishing village. The sea breeze blows softly. Tourists around me always feel that they are keeping their voices down and the atmosphere is peaceful. Old Man Shi is always alone. The small beach next to it is more lively, but also very quiet and isolated, and the noise disappears with the sea breeze. The sunset in the west is beautiful, and the people of Shilaoren are enjoying the softest time of the day.\nReluctantly, before darkness, I left at the most beautiful moment of sunset.\nStone Man is an offshore lonely eroded elderly-like stone. It can be referred to an area. Tourists could get confused when looking for Stone Men. Neither Stone Man beach nor Stone Man sightseeing garden is an ideal location for viewing. Aceess way: take a bus, get off at Stone Man stop of Hong Kong East road. Walk back, turn to side road going to seaside. Enter when arriving at a carpark and go to seaside. That's Stone Man. That day, fishing vessels anchored, scenting old days fishing village vibe. Stone Man was always lonely. Gentle breeze, gentle tourists and humble voices in a hormony. The small beach nearby was more crowded, but identically hormonic. Whispers and laugher were dissolved in air with breeze, fading into silence. Sunset in the west was beautiful.

It was founded in the third year of Chenghua in the Ming Dynasty (1467). The existing building complex is a brick and wood structure of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. It is the oldest existing building in Qingdao urban area. The earliest and only ancient building preserved to this day.\n\nBefore the construction of Qingdao, the Qianhai area where Tianhou Palace is located was originally a place where fishermen used to dry their nets for fishing. At that time, larger villages Qingdao Village and Huiqian Village appeared. Tianhou Palace was Qingdao Village (its name comes from the sea It is part of the island (Little Qingdao), and the nearby residents are mainly fishermen, boatmen and businessmen. In the mid-Ming Dynasty, the maritime shipping industry at the nearby Qingdao Port of the fishing boat wharf (today's Zhanqiao Sea) gradually opened up. With the development of trade with Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong, the Tianhou belief in Fujian also spread to Qingdao. Three Tianhou Palaces were built in Qingdao, but the other two in Shazikou and Cangkou no longer exist.\n\nThe Tianhou Palace located at the entrance of Qingdao was called Tianfei Palace when it was first built. Local people called it the \"Chinese Temple\". It was a place where local fishermen and merchants worshiped the \"Mother of Heaven\" and prayed for shipping and safe life. The Quanzhen Suishan sect of Taoism, whose presiding Taoist belonged to the same sect as the Taiqing Palace in Laoshan in the 1920s. The early building only consisted of three main halls, the Notre Dame Hall, and two auxiliary halls, the Dragon King's Mansion and the Ducai Mansion. After seven repairs and expansions in the Ming, Qing, and Republic of China, it reached its current scale (including the 11th year of Yongzheng in the Qing Dynasty and the 24th year of Guangxu). The scale of the renovation and expansion was relatively large). There are two stone tablets from the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty in the gate of Tianhou Palace. They are the \"Stele of Recruitment to Build a Theater\" in the fourth year of Tongzhi (1865) and the \"Stele of Recruitment to Build a Theater\" in the thirteenth year of Tongzhi (1874). \"Temple Reconstruction Stele\" records the reconstruction of Tianhou Temple at that time, and is also an important source of information for understanding the history of Qingdao.\n\nSince the reconstruction of the theater building in the fourth year of Tongzhi (1865), Tianhou Palace has gradually become a cultural and entertainment place for residents of Qingdaokou. In the \"Records of Haiyuntang\" written by Hu Cunyue, a Qingdao villager, Tianhou Palace was mentioned many times during the Guangxu period. The temple fair was held at that time. At that time, merchants in the nearby area would go to Thean Hou Temple to offer incense and worship on the first, fifteenth and fifteenth day of the first lunar month every year. At this time, the incense in the temple was the most prosperous, and a stage was set up for singing and opera, which attracted a large number of people from the surrounding area. villagers. In addition, during the first lunar month, Thean Hou Temple also holds a large number of folk arts and folk acrobatic performances.\n\nIn 1897, the German Empire built Qingdao. The Qianhai area from Qingdao Railway Station to Huiquan was designated as Qingdao District in the new urban planning. Large areas of the original villages were demolished, and Tianhou Palace was also included in the demolition plan. However, It was abandoned due to strong opposition from the public. Later, the Government-General planned to move the Thean Hau Palace to the Baodao District where the Chinese lived, but it was not implemented due to the change of government between Germany and Japan.\n\nAfter 1949, Qingdao Tianhou Palace was managed and used by cultural and museum units, and was used to organize cultural relics exhibitions many times. During the Cultural Revolution, it was occupied by Shinan's \"Wen Gong Wu Wei\". The double-story cornices of the theater were sawn off, and its glazed and gray tiles were replaced with cement tiles.

The layout adopts the Chinese classical axis type, including the main hall, east and west side halls, left and right wing rooms, grand theater tower, bell and drum tower and ancillary buildings. There are a total of 16 palaces with more than 80 rooms. Except for the theater building, which is covered with glazed tiles, the other buildings all use plain walls, small gray tiles, and are dotted with Su-style colorful paintings. Among the existing ancient buildings in Qingdao, its architectural art and colorful painting art are second to none.\n\nThe grand theater building faces Taiping Road. It is a two-story pavilion with three rooms in width. It has double eaves on the top of the mountain and a gate below. The plaque has the four characters \"Ci Yun Pu Quilt\" written on it. It was placed by Ding Jingchen, a salt merchant from the Chamber of Commerce in 1940. There is a There is a large flagpole and a pair of stone lions.

On both sides of the theater building are the bell tower, the drum tower and the east and west wing rooms. There are two large osmanthus trees planted in the courtyard. They are called \"cinnabar osmanthus\" because the flowers are red. Every time around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the courtyard is filled with the fragrance of osmanthus flowers, attracting a large number of tourists. Come and watch. Enter the second courtyard through the mountain gate. There are two large ginkgo trees in the courtyard, a male and a female. It is said that they were planted when the main hall was rebuilt in the 11th year of Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty (1733). Behind it is the main hall dedicated to the Queen of Heaven. It is three rooms wide and has a single eaves on the top of the mountain. There is a plaque \"Shen Zhao Hai Biao\" written by Emperor Yongzheng (the original plaque has been lost, and the current plaque is copied from the Mazu Temple in Meizhou, Fujian). The Mazu statue is carved from a whole piece of camphor wood and is 2.8 meters high. There are clairvoyant eyes and shunfeng ears on both sides. The east and west auxiliary halls are the Dragon King's Mansion and the Ducai Mansion, and the wings on both sides are used for related exhibitions of the Folk Museum, which includes Queen of Heaven culture, folk handicrafts, folk customs, etc.", "time": 1541578498, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Zhou Wan", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115451108619537638671/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "zh", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXUUPPZwElkKWqpY3tS1R9frOTsUTYinx-ypWHrDD7oH0akOQc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba7", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "Saw it while passing by.

The Southern Line Pass covers Jufeng, Taiqing, Yangkou and Huayan tourist areas and is valid for two days. Yangkou and Huayan are both in the northeast of Mount Laoshan. Generally, Yangkou and Huayan Scenic Spots are visited together. There are sightseeing buses between Yangkou and Huayan.\nThe majesty of the giant peaks, the delicate and changeable postures, and the clarity and profundity of Huayan, each is good at winning. Looking up, the mountain is four hundred meters high. Set up a ropeway. You can hike up and down the mountain in half a day. The Yangkou Tourist Route should be the easier and more convenient among the Laoshan South Routes. The scenic spots along the way are compact and varied. Follow the trail up the mountain to the Taiping Palace on the mountainside. It is similar to the Taoist temples of Taiqing Palace and Shangqing Palace in Taiqing Dynasty, with ancient trees; the footprints and stories of famous Taoist priests such as Liu Ruozhuo and Qiu Chuji are also spread here. There are Sheep Rock and Lion Peak nearby. Lion Peak is a small peak made of stacked rocks. There are trails to reach the top. There are two good places to view the mountains, the sea and the rocks, the Tianyuan on the top of the mountain and the Lion Peak. After descending from Lion Peak, you can go to Youlong Cave, pass the Hunyuan Stone with a star map engraved on it, and walk up the path to reach Shouzi Peak. The peak wall is engraved with the word \"Shou\", the largest one is a Shou in regular script, which is 20 meters high and 16 meters wide. All made in 1993. Then go to the cableway mountain station, then go to Mitian Cave, and go through the cave to the top of the mountain. Tourists filed into the cave, which was dark and humid; they lined up and slowly climbed up the narrow steps. The path slowly turned around among the boulders and climbed up to the height of a building. Coming out of the cave, you suddenly see the light, giving you a dramatic effect of seeing Mount Laoshan again. Go forward and climb a single step to reach the top of the mountain. From a high position, the Yangkou Bathing Beach and the surrounding houses are as flat as the palm of your hand, the Yellow Sea is vast, and the water and the sky meet; resting in the shade of a huge stone, the breeze blows, the sun shines high, the sky and the earth are gorgeous and cool. There is nothing better than this feeling of happiness. Coming down from Tianyuan, go down the mountain road next to Five Fingers Stone.\nThere are many stone carvings on Yangkou, which can be found in Ming, Qing and the Republic of China. The content is mostly travel lyricism, but there are exceptions. Among them, the climbing day of the Lion Peak in the year of Ding Chou \"forever solidifying the rivers and mountains\"; Beside the Sheep Stone, there are seven words of reasoning written by Ke Jia in the year of Xinxi (1981): \"Gold is pure... right and wrong are not allowed...\" which expresses tolerance for others. , stick to things.
