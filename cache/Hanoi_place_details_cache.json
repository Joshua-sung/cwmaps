She told us that both standard and deluxe food is all you can eat buffet. I even asked her when we go to eat lunch do they just divide people into the standard and deluxe group for upgraded food? She said yes there are two places to eat there.\n\nSo instead of the standard $25 per person we paid $40 for the deluxe. The day of the van picks us up. It was cramped. The seats were so tightly packed that your knees were pressed up against the seat in front of you. My wife and I are not big by any means. Both of us are slim Asians under 5'7\". We sat fetal position the whole way. On top of that the van was packed. Every one was shoved in like sardines with every seat taken and could hardly move. My leg fell asleep from being in one position so long.\n\nWhen we arrived at the rest stop restaurant there were a lot of tour guide vans from different travel agencies pulling in and leading all their customers in to eat. Literally everyone ate there. There was no other food options and it was horrendous. I found hair stuck in my food and lost my appetite. I asked the tour guide if this was the only place to eat and if everyone ate here? And he said yes. At this point my wife and I knew that this \"deluxe\" package was a scam. There's no difference. They just want you to pay more.\n\nAfter the tour we went back and complained and she gave us the run around with poor excuses. Saying that our deluxe ride had less people than the standard. (Despite the fact every seat was taken) and that there was another restaurant we should have ate at.\n\nI have no problem with the tour itself.

One was that I'd been booked on the wrong outgoing bus (as I was coming from Sa pa rather than hanoi) so they organised for me to have a beer and snack at the place I was waiting as an apology. The other was that I had booked on the four day tour but when it started it turned out I was the only person on it (as I think the three day must be the standard / more popular one that most people do.)

We loved Mr Kim\u2019s Homestay, Mama Peng looked after us so well and cooked up a storm every night. The quality of the food was excellent! It was a perfect way to end the day sitting out with a beer, watching the activity of the village after a day\u2019s hike.\n\nGenerally there was great catering for vegetarians too as wherever we went there were good veggies & tofu. Not necessarily a huge range or variety, but of course bear in mind you\u2019re staying in a rural area. We were grateful to be eating food that we could see growing in the fields we passed.\n\nEverything felt well organised and it was easy to have a good time. Some mornings we did some cultural things, and we always walked to explore the surroundings once we\u2019d arrived in a new area. Our guide Sunny was indefatigably cheerful, friendly and fun! Ngoc the driver was easygoing and always drove us with care.
