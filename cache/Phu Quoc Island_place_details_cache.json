Located 45 kilometres west of Ha Tien in the far south of Vietnam, the northern part of the island is relatively untouched due to its status as a UNESCO-listed national park but there are plenty of luxurious resorts, funky bars, and quaint cafes along the southern coastline. Aside from beachside activities, visitors can also explore traditional villages, expansive nature parks and Buddhist pagodas, all of which are easily accessible via motorcycle, taxi, bus or even day trips by reputable companies. Catering to just about any budget level and preference, Phu Quoc\u2019s dining scene ranges from local markets selling fresh seafood and Vietnamese street food to expat-owned bistros offering authentic western and European fare.\n\nThe best attractions in Phu Quoc prove that there are plenty of things to do during your tropical vacation besides relaxing on its pristine beaches. Situated 45 kilometres west of Ha Tien, Phu Quoc Island is home to unique Cao Dai and Buddhist temples, vibrant markets, traditional fishing villages, and pepper plantations \u2013 perfect for travellers looking to experience the local lifestyle. Despite the growing number of tourist accommodations and modern facilities along its expansive coastline, more than half of this tropical island is still a UNESCO-listed national park, where you can enjoy a full day of spotting rare wildlife species, hiking, camping, photography and bird-watching. Read on for our list of the most popular things to do on Phu Quoc Island.\n\nPhu Quoc National Park comprises more than half of Phu Quoc Island\u2019s northern region, where adventurous travellers can enjoy a range of outdoor pursuits throughout their tropical vacation. Declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 2010, this massive natural attraction spans over 314, 000 square metres of unique flora and fauna, evergreen forests, and dense mountain ranges. While the majority of Phu Quoc National Park is strictly protected by the Vietnamese government for research purposes, visitors can make their way to the Khu Rung Nguyen Sinh Forest Reserve via Ganh Dau Village as it\u2019s accessible for camping, hiking, bird-watching, and photography. Nature lovers can also spot rare wildlife such as long-tailed macaques, silver langurs, slow lories, otters, and hornbills.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to test out your endurance, Mount Heaven in Phu Quoc National Park is accessible within a challenging four-hour trek through the evergreen forest followed by a 10-metre-tall bamboo ladder. The highest peak in the national park is Mount Chua, which stands 600 metres above sea level, but hiking trails and viewing platforms for the mountain are currently under construction.   Located 26 kilometres north of Duong Dong, the best way to get to Phu Quoc National Park is by booking a day tour or renting a motorcycle. The roads leading towards Ganh Dau Village can be rather bumpy, so only opt for the latter if you\u2019re comfortable navigating through dirt roads.", "time": 1675997797, "translated": false}], "user_ratings_total": 4986}, "timestamp": "2024-07-31 18:05:10"}, "ChIJSzwzkK-WpzERNHNZ2BEHHBE": {"data": {"formatted_address": "22V9+P59, \u0110T46, An Th\u1edbi, Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c, Ki\u00ean Giang, Vietnam", "formatted_phone_number": "0986 881 882", "international_phone_number": "+84 986 881 882", "name": "Phu Quoc Prison Martyrs' Monument", "opening_hours": {"open_now": true, "periods": [{"close": {"day": 0, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 0, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 1, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 1, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 2, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 2, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 3, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 3, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 4, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 4, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 5, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 5, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 6, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 6, "time": "0900"}}], "weekday_text": ["Monday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Tuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Wednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Thursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Friday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Saturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Sunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM"]}, "rating": 4.1, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Scott Chau", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112155090659074223281/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXFR1NLF5H97eT9Rk1Hz9OhKl3sZGUVo9EAsnEU9FmPDz524dIw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "Museum showing the torture of north Vietnamese during the civil war.

The kids attractions did have a lot of realistic and cute props but it was just depressing that nothing was operating or open.

Golden light washing over the water, sailboats silhouetted against the horizon.  Pure magic every night.  But Sunset Town isn't all about sunsets (although, they are pretty spectacular).  There's this amazing energy to the place.  Live music spilling out of cafes, people strolling along the cobblestone streets.  It felt chic and romantic, but also friendly and welcoming.\n\nI spent hours just wandering around, taking in the architecture.  It's supposed to be reminiscent of the Mediterranean, and they did a fantastic job.  Colorful buildings, winding alleys, little piazzas with fountains.  It felt like I'd been transported to another world entirely.\n\nNow, it's not the cheapest place to stay, but hey, you get what you pay for.

Because the second half of the area is only open to toor-buses for viewing.\n\n*The park bus part is divided into two types:\n1. The first is a free guided tour bus, which takes about 20-30 minutes and will take you around the park for large wild animals. You can get up close with animals on the bus. And the important thing is that it has air conditioning, which can avoid the very hot sunlight.\n2. The second type is a small tour-car, which requires an additional fee, I remembe is about VND100,000-200,000/per one. It will take you to three main areas for viewing. If you have difficulty in mobility, it is recommended to take this facility.\n\n-Zoo ticket price: We bought it from Klook this time. It costs about USD 30 per person, which is actually not cheap. In particular, food in the park also requires additional charges, so actually is not really valuable.\n\nOverall, most of the experience in the zoo includes close interactions with animals, their routes arrangements and facilities are very good. It is highly recommended to experience it.\nHowever, judging from zoos in other countries, the fees here are really too high! \ud83e\udd23", "time": 1713694692, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Wendy Jones", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101796633962286761063/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXg736131b4RD5ZBi-W5bYdGPcu5MA_v04ueVzCrN_8ZNU2Y_ZZ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "Lovely place to visit.

The safari lasted about 23 minutes and I enjoyed it. You stop off in different section via the safari bus and we saw a multitude of animals up close. The park itself is lovely and well maintained. As a south african myself I will add this is not a safari in the proper sense but rather an attempt to recreate the experience on a smaller scale. We spent about 4 hours THERE and as someone who's sceptical about \"zoos\" I have to say that the animals are the park's first priority and I'm happy so many rescues found a home.
