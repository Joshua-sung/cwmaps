You can only use public transportation to go up and down the mountain. The park has one of the longest cable car routes in the world: Tianmen Mountain. Cableways, mountain climbing escalators, environmentally friendly vehicles (minibuses and buses), and a complete ban on private cars entering scenic spots are what I appreciate most about Chinese scenic spots.\nTongtian Avenue extends all the way from Tianmen Cave to the city. Private cars are not allowed to go there. You can only take the environmentally friendly vehicles in the scenic area to go up and down the mountain. The number of trains going up and down the mountain is very dense, with almost no interruption. The trains leave as soon as they are full.\nThe 10.77-kilometer-long Tongtian Avenue has a height difference of 1,100 meters. There are many hairpin turns and the road is narrow. Sitting in the car, you have to admire the driver's driving skills. Those who are prone to motion sickness remember to take motion sickness pills half an hour ago. Hey, this must be If you feel dizzy, you can slide your phone if you are not prone to motion sickness like me. The drive up the mountain takes about half an hour. Even though the scenery along the way is foggy.\n\nTianmen Mountain was known as Mengluo Mountain in ancient times. During the Three Kingdoms era in 263 AD, due to the influence of dissolution, the middle of the mountain wall collapsed, forming this natural cave. Sun Xiu, Emperor Wu Jing at the time, regarded this as an auspicious sign and renamed Mengluo Mountain. It is called Tianmen Mountain and has been passed down to this day.\n\nAfter watching Tianmen Cave, you can choose to go up the mountain with the 999-step ladder or take the escalator. Every artificial construction has its pros and cons. The mountain-crossing escalator allows every tourist to go up and down the mountain in the easiest way, but in order to please tourists The practice of digging caves to build escalators has also attracted a lot of criticism. I think China is still looking for a balance point on how to attract tourists while also taking into account environmental protection (actually Taiwan is too~)\n\nIn winter, there is snow and ice on the mountain, and the cable car is undergoing routine maintenance, so you can only choose an environmentally friendly car to go up and down the mountain!\nMountain scenery photos taken in Tianmen Mountain or Zhangjiajie National Forest Park are suitable for conversion to black and white mode, turning them into landscape paintings in one second!", "time": 1578372504, "translated": true}], "user_ratings_total": 26}, "timestamp": "2024-07-10 16:32:05"}, "ChIJeS0sd9MGmzYRkQv5n_6oH2U": {"data": {"formatted_address": "8CMH+2G8, Wulingyuan District, Zhangjiajie, Hunan, China, 427403", "name": "\u96fe\u6d77\u91d1\u9f9f", "rating": 4.5, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Wi Be", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107561719229862217893/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVtA7fxgle3JNlJWC7IuM-Dp784eaEcH7NzD6cvwL2MbPxTfBfP=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "7 years ago", "text": "He who never been to Huangshizhai does not really visit Zhangjiajie.\n\nTake a trip around the mountains.

In particular, it has the four famous sights of Undo, Wolhwi, Hail, and Dongseol, so the changes are endless. I will briefly write down three places that Tianzi Mountain is proud of. That is, Haryong Park, Eopilbong Peak, and Fairy Flowers.\n\nHaryong Park\nThis is a park where a huge statue was erected to commemorate General Helong, the 10th Marshal of China. The statue is 6.5m tall and weighs 9 tons, making it the largest statue ever made in China. The text \u201cHaryong Park\u201d at the entrance to the observatory was written by General Secretary Kang Taek-min himself in March 1995. Koreans also have no reason to respect General Ha-ryong.\n\nappeal pole\nEopilbong Peak is one of the world's most spectacular sights that you must see before you die. This place was named so because the appeal, a brush used by the emperor himself in the past, was placed here. The green pine tree growing on the stone peak looks like a paintbrush stuck upside down.\n\nFairy wreath\nThis place was named so because the wind blowing every spring and summer causes clouds to surround Seokbong (Dolbong Peak) and the appearance of a fairy standing on the top of the hill resembles a fairy. Wild flowers spread out like cotton fields at the bottom and waist of the mountain. Hundreds of peaks, large and small, rise up around it, and the winter snow scenery in particular is one of the most spectacular views in the world.", "time": 1572760762, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "\uc774\uc138\uc5f0", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108488249620515078721/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ko", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJW1FRjjDr6zy9wlsXLnfRRcwSqdtkn8rOVeyYdwwZP7MjavQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 years ago", "text": "How can it look like this?
