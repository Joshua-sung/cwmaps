A huge variety of landscapes. This route starts from Yufuin itself (1.5 km away from train station, let's say). I had read before going that it's a problematic trail and not so well marked. To be honest I only had problems to find the way in one section, I will clarify to help you: after maybe half an hour or one hour depending on your rythm you will reach a forest considerably darker than the previous way you walked. You will recognize it because it is completely plain. After crossing this forest suddenly a landscape like Ireland's hills appears. At this point you have to turn left (at the end of the forest) and watch carefully for a signal (do not follow the concrete way as it leads to a dead end). The signal you are looking for is at your North West after forest's exit. The trail to the signal is not marked, however once you spot and reach it, the way becomes clearer and clearer. A good idea here is to just follow a pipe on the ground you will see some meters after the signal. Afterwards, both of Yufu peaks can be seen, so it's relatively easy to follow the way until the joining with main trail.

When I got back to the car and searched the inside of the car, I thought I had dropped it, but when I looked out the window, I saw that someone had put a rubber band on the inside of the mirror and found the contents of about 55,000 yen, credit card, driver's license, and cash. The card was also safe. I don't know who you are, but I would like to take this opportunity to thank you.\nClimbing? Returning to the hike, I took a plastic bottle with about 7 minutes left in it, a mobile battery, cheap shoes for trekking, and wore regular clothing, including down jackets.\nI have no mountain climbing experience, so the climb was really tough, and I couldn't see what was going to happen, so I thought about going home many times along the way, but I could see that my family, who enjoy mountain climbing as a hobby, would call me pathetic. I decided to take a few steps before stopping and taking a rest, and in the end it took about two and a half hours, but I was able to climb the eastern peak. I was worried about snow at this time of year, but there was only a little snow left near the summit, so there was no problem. Of course, if I climb up, I have to come down, but I slip on fallen leaves and stones and fall dozens of times.Most of the time, my feet flow in front of me and I fall backwards, but sometimes my feet flow backwards, and my knees fall in a big way.

Nishimine...that side is clearly more than intermediate level. I think there are Kusariba and Minewatari. Toho is at a level that is safe for beginners.

Also, as for equipment, it is better to have trekking shoes. There are many places with rocks and stones, so if you wear a low cut, your ankles will get hurt. Also, the harder the sole, the easier it will be. I think you don't need to wear mountain climbing gear except in winter. The upper part requires using your hands, so I think having a pole would get in the way, but for the most part I felt it was easier with a pole. About half of the people were using stock.
