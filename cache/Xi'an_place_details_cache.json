There are passages up and down the city wall near many gates, so there is no need to enter and exit at the same gate. The most famous are the four facing doors:\n\nThe South Gate (Yongning Gate) is the best-restored gate. It is also the gate most commonly used by tourists to climb the city wall, and it is also the gate that has been open the longest. The underground passage of Yongningmen Station on Metro Line 2 can directly lead to Yongningmen, and there is also the Forest of Steles Museum nearby. Personally, I recommend climbing to the wall from this door.\n\nIn addition to the south gate, you can also climb the wall from the east gate (Changle Gate), west gate (Anding Gate), north gate (Anyuan Gate) and some other city gates.\n\nOnce you get on the Yongning Gate and walk to the left, there is a bicycle rental place.  You can rent a bicycle for a single person or go for tandem for two people.\n\nApart from the rental fee, you have to put down a 100\u00a5 deposit, which will be refunded at the return of the bicycle.\n\nRiding along the whole circle will be 13.74 km and can take 1.5 and 2.5 hours depending how much activities you will do in the ride, such as stopping to take photos and going down the wall etc.\n\nRiding on the city wall of 1400 years history is one of the coolest things in all my travels.", "time": 1708467566, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Jutika Krongmongkolkul", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116021043662798402138/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXub1ipQHBhvgi41CA5F8meGzLPfjppH5n8z0tlO1PyYwHvk-0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "one of the most iconic tourist attractions in xi\u2019an. had to to pay for the entrance ticket to enter. very long walking about 7,000 steps for the whole route but worth it. there were bicycles for rent available. not recommended for elderly but nice for younger ones.", "time": 1705459491, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "YL Chong", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108517159472417220173/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLOHElj4BjFWkY55dFAj4zGYUFEoaUVrgkW7wpIX-89RtlPOQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "It is pretty nice to either take a stroll or a bike ride on the Xi\u2019an Wall evening time, enjoying the scenery of the city.", "time": 1718022455, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Deval Mehta", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113103846818218199506/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUMwK22i8ij6iuHnf6RqUNAMDLH92n2t9GlMDbVMGWReKANBypvlQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "This is the best gate of all at the Xi'an wall.

The play of light and shadow danced across the ornate carvings and sturdy columns, each architectural detail a testament to the grandeur of the Tang Dynasty.\n\nCapturing the essence of Yongxingfang Square at night was a photographer\u2019s delight. The interplay of shadows and light cast dramatic patterns across the structures, each snapshot a testament to the enduring beauty of Tang architectural prowess. Our photographs did more than just document; they captured the soul of the square, each frame a narrative woven with elements of ancient grandeur.\n\nSpending an hour in Yongxingfang Square felt all too brief, yet deeply enriching.

The park is expansive, so I would recommend arriving early in the morning to make the most of your time there. The journey from Xi'an takes around two hours, but it is definitely worth it. Admission tickets cost 140 RMB for adults and 100 RMB for students.\n\nOnce you enter the park, you can take amazing photos and explore the different areas. There is a gate for the games park, and another road that leads to the buses which take you to the open wildlife park. The bus ride lasts around 30-40 minutes, during which you can see incredible wild animals roaming freely in their natural habitats. Although the bus doesn't stop at any specific location, I recommend recording the wildlife trip on your phone or camera to preserve this unforgettable experience.\n\nAfter the wildlife trip, the bus drops you off at the park, where you can spend the rest of the day walking, eating, taking photos, and playing games. It's the perfect opportunity to unwind and enjoy the beautiful scenery. Overall, I highly recommend visiting Qingling Wildlife Park for an unforgettable day out in nature.\n\nQingling Wildlife Park is home to a wide variety of animals, including but not limited to Siberian tigers, lions, giraffes, elephants, and pandas. It's an incredible opportunity to see these animals up close and in person. The park is beautifully designed and maintained, with plenty of greenery and picturesque landscapes. It's a great place to relax and escape from the hustle and bustle of city life. In addition to the wildlife park, there are also other attractions such as a water park, a roller coaster, and a 5D cinema. There's truly something for everyone at Qingling Wildlife Park.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the animals, there are educational exhibits and presentations throughout the park. You can learn about their habitats, behaviors, and conservation efforts. The park is also committed to environmental sustainability. They use solar energy to power some of their facilities, and have implemented waste reduction and recycling programs. The park staff are friendly and helpful, and there are plenty of amenities such as food stalls, restrooms, and seating areas throughout the park.", "time": 1682915558, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Prof Samir Mukherjee", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116981675404275176604/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXZnQzw-5lwbrWeB7eM7FYi3V-d5E9emwwC4AfwGWCc2cTInTZc=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "6 years ago", "text": "Great Zoo, very famous for white Panda.", "time": 1506015002, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Mordred Cheung", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107033950896406409970/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXpKHV0td34TK4wgZCIVkZiGhDrd8-yC3YRAd4PT2kl9-hCWkST7w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "You can feed the beasts with meat that staff give to you, which is so fun!", "time": 1602934566, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Cici Yin", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115170176598784457214/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVx9UIgYeitNofS72nn0mNIjbyADaIcKZzOTsn_YU0YTeePRwU=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "11 years ago", "text": "i dont want 2 go again", "time": 1357875317, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "M K", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113174419383664630140/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ja", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUYFGp8aB8IZgRlB7K3z7unFUc2zrUeeFsK_lRowCSw3Oous33P=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 years ago", "text": "The closest station is Weiqu South Station, which is the last stop on Metro Line 2, but it is far from the zoo, so take bus number 334 and get off at the 24th stop, Wildlife Park Station, which is about a 10-minute walk.\nThe location is inconvenient if you don't have a car.", "time": 1642992410, "translated": true}], "user_ratings_total": 21}, "timestamp": "2024-07-15 11:14:10"}, "ChIJJyQdK-t6YzYRt_sn3iiLGMA": {"data": {"formatted_address": "7X5C+P84, Dong Da Jie, \u949f\u697c\u5546\u5708\u7891\u6797\u533a Xi An Shi, Shan Xi Sheng, China, 710005", "name": "Xi'an Wall Changle Gate", "rating": 4.7, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Ales Tvrdy", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105935988495172074393/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU8PQC5PK3dCXwEVYtC78WvMkjOkJNVSN7vrLzKyXEqAJikU-_s=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 weeks ago", "text": "It's always nice to come back and see the city from the old walls.

There are two options for climbing this significant mountain, either going on a cable car to halfway or climbing the whole mountain by yourself. For those inactive, I highly recommend the first option as it allows you to witness the astonishing view of mountains and valleys whilst reducing how much you walk. I barely do sport but when I chose the first option, I was able to climb to the top without breaking a sweat. I recommend climbing two steps at a time as it is easier. The higher you climb, the more beautiful and astonishing the view. The upper view of nature's creation through the mist is a delightful experience. The delicate wind that breezes on my skin creates a clear contrast to when I am on the ground. Not just the aesthetics of the mountain is amazing, the smell is also so special, the smell of nature.\n\nYou will not have to worry about hunger or toilet issues when climbing on the mountain, there are shops on top. The danger issues are limited on the mountain, as there are chains which surrounds the path, there is no possible way where you can \"accidentally\" slip off and fall to your death if you are being careful.\n\nI highly recommend those to climb this magnificent mountain as the insane aesthetic bestowed by this mountain is like one of a lifetime which you would never forget. The close interaction bewen you and nature will be closer than ever, feeling as if you were mixed within it. As you looked down, the houses in the distance looked like ants, allowing you to obtain the feeling of being in control of everything you look at.\n\nThe steps on the way down may be a tiny bit steep so you may have to take your time. It took me 6 hrs to go up and down the mountain.\n\nRemember to bring some gloves and not just one bottle of water if you decide to go here.\n\nHighly recommend this beautiful place.

So what does the Tomb of the Living Dead in Zhongnan Mountain mean? The Tomb of the Living Dead is where living people live. It is said that Wang Chongyang, the head of the Quanzhen Sect, practiced in the tomb for two years and left a Qi Jue poem to describe this cultivation method. So is the Tomb of the Living Dead real? Where is the Tomb of the Living Dead? Now we will take you to explore the unsolved mysteries about the Tomb of the Living Dead.\n\nWhat does the Tomb of the Living Dead in Zhongnan Mountain mean?\n\nIn Chapter 39 of Yitian Slaying the Dragon, Yang Guo and Xiao Longnu's daughter Yang Bing appeared to help and rescued Zhang Wuji's adoptive father Xie Xun. Later, Zhang Wuji thanked her and wanted to ask her name, but she only said, \"Behind Zhongnan Mountain, there is the Tomb of the Living Dead, and the Condor Heroes have disappeared from the world.\"\n\nAt this time, the meaning of this sentence is that I am a descendant of the Condor Heroes. At the end of \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\", Yang Guo and Xiao Longnu decided to retire to the world and return to the Tomb of the Living Dead to spend the rest of their lives together.\n\nThe original meaning of this sentence is that after a living person enters the tomb of the living dead, his past self is already dead and his past self is buried. Only by abandoning everything in the past can we realize the Tao and the true meaning.\n\nIn \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\", Wang Chongyang, the head of the Quanzhen sect, practiced in the Tomb of the Living Dead for two years in order to isolate himself from the world and concentrate on enlightenment. In the end, he was completely reborn in the Tomb of the Living Dead and attained enlightenment. While he was practicing, he also wrote a Qijue poem \"The Tomb of the Living Dead Presents Ning Bo Gong\", one of which reads like this:\n\nThe living dead are here, just because of wind, fire, earth and water. In the tomb, I took real elixir every day and exchanged a little bit of dust for my mortal body. The living dead, the living dead, death in life is a good cause, the silence in the tomb is pure and quiet, separated from the mortal world.\n\nIt can be seen that Wang Chongyang was practicing in the Tomb of the Living Dead at that time.\n\nBut someone has to ask, these are all records in novels. Is the Tomb of the Living Dead real? Does the Tomb of the Living Dead really exist? If it is the real Tomb of the Living Dead, where is it?\n\nThe Tomb of the Living Dead is so deep that no one dares to enter.\n\nThe Tomb of the Living Dead is real, it really does exist. The Tomb of the Living Dead is located in the Chengdao Palace, 40 kilometers southwest of the ancient capital of Xi'an, and 4 or 5 miles away from the Chongyang Palace. It is now located in Zu'an Town, Hu County, Xi'an City.\n\nThe four characters \"Tomb of the Living Dead\" are engraved on the stone tablet in front of the tomb. Experts once visited this place to investigate, and after opening the tomb passage, they found that there was indeed a basement in the Tomb of the Living Dead, exactly as described in the novel. It's just that the basement is bottomless and no one dares to go in. For safety reasons, experts feared that someone might break in without permission, so they sealed the tomb passage with soil.

The heritage park is divided into two parts: the heritage area and the exhibition area. The ruins area includes the remaining buildings, the mountain gate, the main hall, and the mausoleum of Emperor Qin II Hu Hai; the exhibition area includes the tourist service center, the Qin Dynasty Exhibition Hall, and the Exhibition Hall of Unearthed Cultural Relics. The entire cemetery covers an area of \u200b\u200bmore than 20 acres. Free and open.\nDirectly south of the ruins area is a three-bay mountain gate with a red door and red pillars. Passing through the mountain gate and climbing up the stairs, you will find a hard-mountain-style hall built in the Qin Dynasty architectural style. There are a group of statues \"referring to deer as horses\" displayed in the hall. Colorful portraits and text introductions of Hu Hai, Zhao Gao, Ziying, Yan Le, who are more than 2 meters tall.\nOn the corridor leading to the main hall along the steps from the entrance gate, the representative historical dynasties of China are marked in order according to the Gregorian calendar. Taking one step will enter a dynasty, giving people the feeling of walking into a time machine and going directly from the present dynasty to the Qin Dynasty.\nAt the very end of the main hall is Hu Hai's mausoleum, which is made of earth and is circular. There is a stone tablet on the north side of the tomb. The six official script characters \"Mausoleum of the Second Emperor of Qin\" are inscribed on the stele. It was written in the 41st year of Qianlong's reign (1776 AD) by Bi Yuan, the Minister of War and deputy censor of Shaanxi Province, and by the official of Xianning County. Yin Zhi erected a monument. Because at that time, this place belonged to Xianning County, Shaanxi Province.\nOn August 6, 1956, Hu Hai's tomb was listed as the first batch of key cultural relics protection units by the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee, and a monument was erected by the Xi'an Municipal People's Government.\nThere are green pines and cypresses around the tomb of Hu Hai, accompanied by peach trees, redbuds and ginkgo trees. Winding paths lead to secluded areas, with birds chirping and flowers fragrant. In mid-March, the peach blossoms behind the tomb and the redbuds in front of the tomb are blooming, adding a bit of liveliness to this solemn place.\nHowever, it is doubtful whether this tomb is that of Hu Hai. Data show that in 2009, Xi'an cultural relics and archaeologists conducted archaeological exploration of the tomb and found that the tomb was a multi-chamber tomb with a long slope and brick passages. Judging from the shape of the tomb, it should be a Han Dynasty tomb.\n\nThe Qin Shang Exhibition Hall in the exhibition area takes the main historical events experienced by Qin II as the main line, and uses the rise and decline of Qin civilization as the background of the story. While displaying the civilization of the Qin Dynasty, it also shows the history of the Qin Dynasty from prosperity to decline. process. There is also an exhibition of fine cultural relics unearthed in Qujiang New District that is held year-round. However, I was in a hurry and did not visit it, which is a pity.\n\nPersonally, I think the most intriguing thing about the entire scenic spot is the four couplets on the mountain gate. I have specially excerpted it for you, the readers, to enjoy.\nUnder the plaque on the mausoleum of Emperor Qin II, a couplet reads:\nIf we fail to preserve the legacy of our late emperor\u2019s great achievements, a handful of dirt beside the pond will only retain eternal sorrow.\nKong Gui has been an emperor and a powerful king for thousands of years. How many people have paid homage to him?\n\nUnder the plaque, a couplet reads:\nThis fortune may decline, this emperor may be sad. The lonely tomb in the setting sun cannot be extinguished for a long time.\nIts rise and fall are also sudden. Before the clear water of Qujiang River, I ponder the ups and downs of the second generation.\n\nUnder the plaque of the Master of Funerals, the couplet reads:\nThe anecdotal story of one man destroying himself and having his second son die will only serve as a laughingstock for thousands of years to come.\nWithout benevolence and righteousness, how can one protect one's property? The desolate smoke and decaying grass remain, but the lonely grave remains and weeps at the setting sun.\n\nUnder the plaque of Kuanggu Meditation, the couplet reads:\nAt that time, the country was destroyed and the fragrance was remnant. Qin Gui II was not the only one who died.\nOn this day, the wind is clear and the moon is bright, but the lonely tomb is facing thousands of people\nYuan Tengfei once said that reading history is reading people\u2019s hearts. History always repeats itself, often with striking similarities, because people's hearts never change. If we don't learn from the lessons of the capsized boat, then things will rise and fall, and the boat may capsize again.
