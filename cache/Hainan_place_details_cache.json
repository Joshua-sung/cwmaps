It was our first time visiting Sanya. After researching through Google and TripAdvisor reviews, we decided to have our special anniversary trip at RC Sanya.\n\nAs an Ambassor Elite member of Bonvoy, we were welcomed with warm and kind gestures from complimentary pick up from the airport, a designated personal butler services, sweet in room decorations welcoming us and on our special day with bottles of sparkling wines, flowers, cake, balloons, daily fresh whole fruits and fresh coconuts, attentive housekeeping team, daily F&B credit, spa treat and manymore.\n\nWe booked the garden pool villa hoping to be upgraded to the beachfront villa. Unfortunately, we did not get any luck this time. Haha. The entire property looked bit tired and less appealing.... we were kind of worried when we reached the hotel lobby... But then our impressions changed almost immediately when we stepped into our villa, it's well maintained, all the electrical appliances were up to date and practical, large screen TV's, automatic toilet seat (one of the best thoughtful designs I've ever used), USB cable friendly at every corner of the rooms, Nespresso machine... The huge and deep bathtub was a big plus! \ud83d\udc4d\u2764\ufe0f How we wished we could stay here when doing several times of Hotel mandatory quarantine during the past 3 years of pandemic. \ud83d\ude06\n\nNow we would like to highlight the most important assets of RC Sanya, the people! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude0d\u2665\ufe0f Oliver, our personal butler, who would go all the extra miles to make us happy. He jotted down all our likes and dislikes when checking us in, and shared some special info's like our special diet to F&B chef's and team. Shirley the manager, Frank, Chef Tom from Pearl Restaurant and Chef Andy from Sofia Italian restaurant did a marvellous job in accommodating our preferences especially when one of us was suffering from tummy flu before going to Sanya. Zoe, who helped us getting medical consultation and medicines. And also not to forget Jilly, Viky and the breakfast team at Sand Grill and Bar. Everyone was just too kind enough to tailor something for us out of the menu throughout our stay, we were truly grateful for all the efforts extended to us. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0d\u2665\ufe0f Our spa masseuse ladies Lily and Amy, thank you for pampering us with your skillful hands. Chen Xiang Li  and Carry from housekeeping team had made our stay amazingly comfortable. They're extremely hardworking, always with smiling faces wherever we met them. As frequent travellers, we usually don't encourage daily make up rooms as we find it's not necessary plus not environmentally friendly. Somehow I just kind of looking forward to the room being dressed by Xiang Li and Carry, their attetion to details, the neat and tidiness of displaying guest's personal items were just beyond 5 stars service!\n\nWe also enjoyed some of our nights listening to live bands performed by Leon and Walds at Sand Grill. They could really sing chinese songs too! It would be even better if the bands could sing little longer than 21:30? That's a shame to leave guest's moods hanging when the night is still young. \ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\ude05\n\nLast but not least, our 'family' in Sanya, Quan who was being appointed to drive us around Sanya. Since it's a 8 hours long day trip, we invited Quan to join us along while sightseeing and dinner together, we feel that would be more considerate than just letting him wait for us in the car all day. In fact, I think Quan enjoyed as much as we did and we have shared some of our family histories towards the end of the day.\n\nThank you once again for making our 15th anniversary a memorable one!

Don't let that put you off. It just means you can find a corner of it to suit you.\n\nTaxi to/from Sanya Airport is about 140-150 CNY and 45 minutes. Atlantis Water Park is well worth a visit and ten minutes taxi from the Sofitel.\n\nRooms here are beautiful! So well-appointed and maintained. Beautiful views from my room, huge bath and that amazing Sofitel bed.\n\n4 swimming pools to choose from and the main pool features a swim-up bar.\n\nLots of facilities for families and couples alike, and the place is large enough that you won't be annoyed by a different demographic to you.\n\nFood and Beverage is excellent for both Asian and western cuisine. Breakfast is a massive offering with something for everyone. Amazing fresh-baked bread every morning is sensational.\n\nThe Club Lounge is an oasis of calm and a lovely place to enjoy breakfast or evening cocktails and canapes if you are able to gain entry due to Accor status or room type.\n\nThe staff are great here and well trained. The service staff have enough English to cover their roles and they are so sincere with their efforts to please you. I have to say Carrie, Lisa and Amy in the bar were excellent and very obliging.\n\nAlso, Alice Chen as Manager of The Club was exceptional at her job. She is charming, caring and has her guests' comfort and experience as a priority all the time. Nothing is too much trouble for her. She is a super star.\n\nFinally, F&B Manager, Adam, is one of the nicest people you could hope to meet. He stopped by every day to chat, get feedback and offer suggestions. He's a huge asset to the team here and is brilliant at his job.\n\nAs a Platinum Accor Plus member, I stay over 70 nights per year in Accor Hotels worldwide. I would put this property in my \"Top 3\" without any hesitation. It is all about good facilities, good food and beverage and the guest experience. This hotel excels in all three.

We had a Suite. This is a superior room with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a huge living room and an equally huge balcony. The view from our room was Ocean View (sea view). On my YouTube channel (UlyanaSilina) there is a detailed review of the SUITE room at the Howard Johnson Resort Sanya Bay 5* from 2023. Housekeeping was done every day and everything was very clean. They don't take tips in China, they're afraid. One day, we caught a cleaner (a young guy) and directly and urgently gave him a Kazakhstani chocolate bar in gratitude.\n\nHotel area. The hotel itself, like the building, and its territory are huge. There is a place to walk, sit and relax. The hotel is divided into two wings: western and eastern. There are 3 swimming pools on the territory, but during our stay only one was working - the central one, but it was quite enough for all hotel guests. The pool (November 2023) was not heated. But the air temperature was 28 degrees Celsius. Near the central pool there is a jacuzzi with Garra rufa fish (peeling fish), 50 yuan for a 30-minute procedure. There is also a BBQ restaurant and a Korean restaurant on site. We have not been to any of these restaurants, because... The prices seemed expensive to us. We went outside the hotel for lunch and dinner. On my YouTube channel (UlyanaSilina) there is a detailed review of the Howard Johnson Resort Sanya Bay 5* hotel from 2023.\n\nInfrastructure near the hotel. Not far from the hotel, literally 200 meters from its main entrance, there is a Phoenix seafood square and a food court. We ate there. The prices are reasonable: 20-30 yuan for a huge portion of Chinese noodle soup. There are MacDonalds and KFC. There are also many shops and boutiques with things near the hotel. There is a large supermarket where we bought beer, sweets, and fruit. On my YouTube channel there is a video about this supermarket, where I show the assortment and prices as of November 2023, as well as shops and a food court next to the HoJoSy hotel. We also took a taxi several times to Dadonghai to the famous \u201c12 Chairs\u201d cafe to eat seafood.\n\nWe visited the sights of Hainan (Monkey Island, Nanshan Buddhism Center, Li and Mao village, \u201cThe Deer Turned its Head\u201d park) by taxi, which stands right next to the main entrance to the hotel. But there is one caveat: when you take a taxi, you need to tell the driver Meter - this means that you will only go according to the meter. Otherwise, the taxi driver himself will tell you the cost of a one-way trip, which will be at least 50 yuan more expensive than according to the meter. As they say, a tourist who is not deceived is not a tourist ;)\n\nSea and beach. Let me immediately mention that there are no sunbeds or umbrellas on the beach! I don\u2019t know what it was like here before the pandemic, but during our visit in November 2023 there was none of this. We took towels from the Towel Center (on the hotel grounds, by the central pool) and used them as bedding on the sand. The beach itself is clean. There aren't many people. The Chinese bathe almost never or rarely. The water in the South China Sea in November is like fresh milk, warm. But muddy due to the sandy bottom. This, of course, is not the Red Sea of \u200b\u200bEgypt with its clear water and underwater world, but it is also very cool and useful... There were some water activities like hydro scooters and boats, but we did not use them, because... Everywhere there is a language barrier in misunderstanding of the language. Once we went specifically to the beach in Dadonghai Bay - there were, of course, many times more people there than in Sanya Bay. In general, Dadonghai is for a noisy holiday with a bunch of cafes, shops, shopping centers, and Sanya Bay is for a quiet and peaceful holiday.\n\nWe had to check out from the hotel on November 23, 2023 at 02:00 am. We came to the reception, handed over our room card and waited for the transfer. The deposit of 500 yuan was returned, there were no questions asked of us.", "time": 1704791039, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Tatyana Shegay", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102962076793826801242/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLGnyLtuESjVL_S0lVAYjIHr5Z5KAQzOWYnJIdHtTk2NnJvnA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "Excellent service, largely thanks to the guide Andrey (Ming) from Selfie travel, if it were possible we would give him all 10 stars.
