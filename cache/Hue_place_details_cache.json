Although small, they cause discomfort for tourists and reflect the manager's poor talent and intelligence.\n\nOne is: the current tour ticket price is 200k/person, but when entering, you cannot visit Thai Hoa Palace because it is being demolished due to restoration => so why not reduce the ticket even for guests but sell it for 200k?\n\nSecond: Hue ancient capital relics is an important and meaningful heritage in many aspects, like a giant outdoor museum => there should be a tour guide to give a systematic and systematic introduction about this place. and should not be charged. Yet this place still charges a demonstration fee. The amount of 150k is not large, but our way of dealing with history like that is excessive and lacking in education.\n\nThird: electric cars here are charged by the hour, 1 hour is 300k, a car can carry 7 people and still charges 300k. But the tram can't go very far, it just runs around in circles, and can't get close to the nine Gods. Seeing many aunts and uncles trying their best to ride the tram but the tickets were too expensive so they had to walk, made me feel sorry for them. Only families that are well-off can afford to rent an electric car. => Tickets pile up on tickets, squeezing tourists, not serving thoroughly, in the end still \"shaping\" tourists to the bone. You should review the price of the electric car or the exit route to make it more convenient for passengers.\n\nFourth: relics are displayed for sale haphazardly inside, some are real but some are fake, losing the solemnity of a big relic => regardless of money, causing a lot of resentment for tourists.\n\nThis is my subjective opinion, I hope to receive more constructive feedback.", "time": 1687938935, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Chi\u00ean L\u00fd", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105702522761265098616/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "vi", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWo1csbv9NYTjzzJO8oUxtDC_PPh4S0pMRJGO3_DnLaOyyeMv8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "A unique architectural conservation area that still retains many relics.", "time": 1621234208, "translated": true}], "user_ratings_total": 54, "website": "http://hueworldheritage.org.vn/"}, "timestamp": "2024-08-05 18:25:52"}, "ChIJXTzT5zShQTERqHR0FzXlafA": {"data": {"formatted_address": "FH7G+J54, Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i, Thu\u1eadn Ho\u00e0, Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 Hu\u1ebf, Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Hu\u1ebf, Vietnam", "name": "Nh\u00e0 \u0110\u1ed3 Gate", "opening_hours": {"open_now": true, "periods": [{"open": {"day": 0, "time": "0000"}}], "weekday_text": ["Monday: Open 24 hours", "Tuesday: Open 24 hours", "Wednesday: Open 24 hours", "Thursday: Open 24 hours", "Friday: Open 24 hours", "Saturday: Open 24 hours", "Sunday: Open 24 hours"]}, "rating": 4.5, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Canadian Traveller (CanadianTraveller)", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100967677435732357935/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVzwRrE-EFPTodLXWX1PNpZWxy0onM3IKU8uL2C_5heQId1mBU3=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Walked through here to enter inperiak city, although there is no walking path and it's one way traffic heading out of imperial city.", "time": 1676612045, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "B\u00e1ch Bo", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115342274161161372470/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "vi", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX17qX5bfxS8ThtP0fybOyJYVMtuEdGUd6jHitb3frvID2jIkE=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "Ancient\nTree green\nChanh Nam Mon gate is located in the south of Kinh Thanh, at the end of Nguyen Trai street, people still call it Nha Do gate.

However when I went to jump on my bike to ride it up the track with the others. The security guards said I must not enter. I asked them why and they said to me. \u2018NO vietnam!\u2019 And demanded I pay them. I explained to them that I had just payed them the 60k previously.\nEither they chose to ignore this or had conveniently forgotten. I rode up the track after one had softened up a little bit and was less aggressive. However at the top Carpark I was greeted by another guard. Who was quite angry.

Special thanks to Suja and Mary for their outstanding service.\n\nA heartfelt thanks to Saurabh, who went out of his way to make our stay unforgettable. He personally checked with us about our food preferences and instructed the in-house chef to whip up some amazing prawn curry and king fish curry for lunch\u2014just the comfort food we were looking for! Every detail, from the food presentation, to the way the salad was cut and the choice of cutlery, showed personal attention had been paid, which truly stood out. For breakfast, we enjoyed aloo puri that reminded us of home and some lovely egg preparations with the perfectly made adrak ki chai - rare to find in Goa!\n\nThe hotel has a very positive vibe, making for a relaxed and enjoyable experience. A special shout-out to Sandeep, the in-house cab driver, who made our travels around Goa stress-free.\n\nHUE GUH The Porto Candolim has now become our go-to destination whenever we visit Goa.

It incorporates elements from three distinct architectural styles - traditional Vietnamese, French and Italian Renaissance - and embodies an era of Western influence in Vi\u1ec7t Nam.\n\nIt is among the five main palaces of the former royal citadel, along with Th\u00e1i H\u00f2a, C\u1ea7n Ch\u00e1nh, C\u00e0n Th\u00e0nh, and Kh\u00f4n Th\u00e1i. In 1947, the palace was practically destroyed by the war with only its foundations remaining intact.\n\nInvestments in the reconstruction of Ki\u1ebfn Trung Palace were significant to rebuild the foundation walls, railing system, front and back yards, and two floors with a height of about 14m, on a construction site of about 975sq.m.\n\nOther small works such as brick pedestals, fountains, cannons, guard houses, and gardens are also part of the investment plan.\n\nThe highlight of Ki\u1ebfn Trung Palace lies in the unique colourful patterns inlaid with porcelain in vivid decorative themes to create the soul of the work. The restoration of the porcelain mosaic is about 80 per cent complete and has involved the participation of many skilled and experienced artisans in the field of folk art.\n\nThe work began in February 2019 and has entered the final phase. It will help preserve and uphold the UNESCO-recognised Complex of Hu\u1ebf Monuments in the central province of Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean-Hu\u1ebf.", "time": 1706853052, "translated": false}], "user_ratings_total": 231}, "timestamp": "2024-08-05 18:26:45"}, "ChIJpyfDhwqkQTERlN49WWrv6-Y": {"data": {"formatted_address": "CH9F+42V, Th\u1ee7y B\u1eb1ng, H\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ee7y, Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Hu\u1ebf, Vietnam", "name": "Mausoleum of Emperor Thieu Tri", "opening_hours": {"open_now": true, "periods": [{"close": {"day": 0, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 0, "time": "0700"}}, {"close": {"day": 1, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 1, "time": "0700"}}, {"close": {"day": 2, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 2, "time": "0700"}}, {"close": {"day": 3, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 3, "time": "0700"}}, {"close": {"day": 4, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 4, "time": "0700"}}, {"close": {"day": 5, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 5, "time": "0700"}}, {"close": {"day": 6, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 6, "time": "0700"}}], "weekday_text": ["Monday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Tuesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Wednesday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Thursday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Friday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Saturday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Sunday: 7:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM"]}, "rating": 4.3, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Mich L", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100175801677049684106/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUQPoKVi3SrSmadbelJ40AaDzjreqDkVXTa6peiUuuxFHEFQ8ggJA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "6 months ago", "text": "It\u2019s currently under a lot of restoration.

Du Ta School was built in 1849 to prepare for the grand celebration of Pentecost by Queen Mother Tu Du, mother of King Tu Duc. Ta built on a lovely square lake, 530 m2 wide, on the east side of the main palace, facing south. The structure is in the style of Hue's traditional Ruong house with a square frame (Phuong communal house), a room with four wings, 16 pillars, and a roof covered with green glazed tube tiles. All three east, west and south sides of Truong Du Ta are surrounded by corridors. Later this corridor was removed, the southern part was renovated into a crab shell house called Luong Phong Dinh.\n\nAlthough the structure is in the style of a beam house with a quite dense column system, the architectural space of this weight house is still very airy because the door system on all 4 sides is very wide, the plank wall system is replaced with bright glass so it stands tall. Even inside the house, people can still clearly observe the outside landscape. Some panels and partitions in the house are meticulously decorated with extremely elaborate carvings and perforations, thus increasing their aesthetic effectiveness.\n\nOverall, in terms of both scale and structural form, Truong Du Ta is only a relatively small and simple architectural work, but in return, because it is placed in a reasonable space, Truong Du Ta creates beauty.

As soon as you walk in, you're like, \"This place is CLASSY!\" It\u2019s got that luxurious, Gatsby-like vibe, and it totally fits the dining experience. But the real star of the show here is the food. It\u2019s all in the name: 'Hue \u4f11' means 'rest', and '135 degrees' is apparently the sweet spot for cooking meat. And this is the foundation for the steak here \u2013 and they nail it. I\u2019m talking next-level flavor and texture from beef that's been aged for weeks before reaching your plate. The chef grills it all up right there in front of you, which is an awesome touch. The non-meat dishes are also all supurb and insanely creative. Now, it's not exactly budget-friendly, but trust me, the experience is worth every penny. Think of it as splurge -- or the perfect spot for a special meal.
