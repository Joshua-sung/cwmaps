The staff members are highly professional, courteous, and attentive, ensuring a pleasant and safe environment for all visitors. The rides are well-maintained, and the water quality is pristine, contributing to an enjoyable experience.\n\n**Value and Attractions:** The variety of rides offered at Dam Sen Water Park is commendable, providing a good mix of thrills and relaxation. The presence of adequate safety guards ensures a sense of security, allowing visitors to enjoy the attractions with peace of mind. While it might not be the largest water park, it offers a welcomed escape from the hustle and bustle of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n**Concerns at the Entrance Counter:** However, a major downside surfaced at the entrance counter, where phone covers and floats are sold. The exorbitant pricing of $20 for a phone cover, coupled with the staff's attempt to push unnecessary purchases by stating that each cover accommodates only one phone, appears exploitative, especially towards foreigners. This practice of trying to extract more money from visitors by enforcing unnecessary purchases significantly detracted from an otherwise enjoyable experience.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Despite the regrettable encounter at the entrance counter, Dam Sen Water Park remains a decent option for a day of relaxation and fun in Ho Chi Minh City. The park's cleanliness, well-maintained rides, and attentive staff contribute to an overall positive experience. However, potential visitors should be cautious and aware of possible tactics aimed at extracting additional money.\n\nIn summary, Dam Sen Water Park offers an enjoyable getaway from the city's hustle and bustle, featuring well-maintained rides and a clean environment. Nonetheless, the exploitative practices at the entrance counter regarding the sale of phone covers and floats merit attention and consideration before planning a visit.", "time": 1702437447, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Ema Kolb", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103467491605154552024/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocK7-A1qn9qPdVEfmKcwbzAwQ3saf4eyYjWSxNGLChR4numhEA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "Such a fun waterpark!

The only thing we had to do was book our flight to Vietnam and Loc took care of all the rest. His company booked all of our hotels, tours, intra-country flights and drivers. He was even waiting for us at the airport when we arrived. We experienced things we never would have found on our own. We went to restaurants that didn't have a single westerner in them; we had lunch at a restaurant in someone's backyard in the Mekong delta; we went to a small fish market in central Vietnam where we watched fish being bought right from the boat.\n\nWe booked the mid-tier package so we were shocked at how nice all of the hotels were. They all had large, modern and comfortable rooms with excellent AC. We had a motorbike tour to 4 different restaurants in Ho Chi Minh, a country-side motorbike tour in Hoi An, saw countless temples and pagodas, hiked through the jungle, and even did an overnight cruise in Halong Bay. We had many encounters with locals thanks to Loc. He knew that our goal was to experience the culture so that's how he targeted our tour. He will customize each tour according to your preferences.\n\nI really do want to emphasize that this tour was surprisingly reasonably priced. We encountered a group taking a bus tour that followed the same basic path as our tour. Their tour was two days shorter and most of the excursions were \"extra\".

They seem to be more for the locals, as it's the cheapest way to travel throughout the country. Did 17hrs from HCMC to Da Nang, and at the end I felt like my head was still moving, as well as such a lack of sleep. Had a family on one bed in the cabin at one point, and people are very loud even at late hours. The pillows were full of mold and bacteria, a massive health hazard. Lucky I bought my neck pillow and used that. They let people smoke wherever on the train and they smoked right where the air-conditioning vents are, so plumes of cigarette smoke seeped into the cabins periodically throughout the ENTIRE trip. It blocked my nose and made my sinuses and head sick by the end of the trip. Very bad and a massive health concern for healthy passengers. The service was mostly unfriendly, and seemed somewhat racist towards foreigners, as well. One lady worker shooed me away for trying to ask something, very stupid and ignorant women. The toilets were 3rd world filthy as they are not maintained and had no supply of toilet paper. Maybe if that women used her bad energy towards cleaning, the trains might be somewhat comfortable. Imo, for 60AUD one way, it was still way too expensive for the quality and service received. I got a refund for the return leg through the travel agency I booked through, and bought a ticket on Vietnam Airlines, and was very glad I did. These people have NO health standards and are very lazy. Paying this amount of money for this level of service and cleanliness, is just not acceptable. You would be shut down immediately if you charged even 1 dollar in Australia for this service. It doesn't take much to fix these problems, but the apathy is rife, unfortunately.
