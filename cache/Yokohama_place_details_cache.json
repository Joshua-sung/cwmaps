Upon arrival, be prepared for a bit of a walk from the parking area. If you\u2019re visiting with children, bringing a stroller or a cart can be a lifesaver for the trek ahead.\n\n\nThe park features a circular path with athletic play equipment spaced every 10-20 meters, ensuring that children have a variety of activities to enjoy without getting bored. The presence of a small stream, perfect for water play, adds to the charm, offering a refreshing respite during the summer months. While it\u2019s unclear if the stream is man-made or natural, it\u2019s a hit with the kids either way.\n\n\nKODOMONOKUNI is not just about play; it also houses a zoo, a pool, and leisure facilities with plenty of playground equipment. A visit to the livestock farm managed by Snow Brand is a must, where you can try the special Sungreen milk and ice cream.\n\n\nThe park is open from 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM, with last entry at 3:30 PM. During August, the hours extend to 5:00 PM1.\nAdmission fees are 600 JPY for adults, 200 JPY for elementary/junior high school students, and 100 JPY for children aged 3 and above1.\nParking is available with a fee of 1,000 JPY per day for cars1.\n\n\nPlan to stay for at least 120 minutes to fully enjoy the park1.\nBring a picnic to enjoy amidst the greenery, or indulge in the park\u2019s specialty products.\nEnjoy your visit to KODOMONOKUNI, where fun and adventure await for the whole family!", "time": 1714279848, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Ada Hui", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117884462454452115814/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXE0LpPvt1xchsLaklQivrOyY4-FJfRsSpHDmED_Tg9XN2-luviww=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "My husband used to come here when he was a little kid!

This place is truly a haven of joy and endless entertainment.\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye was the incredible variety of slides. From twisty-turny spirals to exhilarating straight drops, the kids were spoiled for choice. Each slide brought laughter and squeals of delight, and the safety measures put my mind at ease.\n\nBut that's not all! The park boasts a vast playing area, allowing children to run around and explore to their heart's content. The addition of water play made it even more enjoyable on those hot summer days. The splash of water and gleeful giggles filled the air, creating an atmosphere of pure joy.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, there is a small zoo nestled within the park. Kids can get up close and personal with friendly animals, fostering a sense of wonder and a love for nature. The caretakers were knowledgeable and patient, making the experience both educational and delightful.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the small pond where kids can ride boats. It was such a charming sight to see little captains steering their vessels through the calm waters. The sense of adventure and imagination was palpable, and it brought back nostalgic memories of my own childhood.\n\nWhat truly impressed me was the train-like bus that takes you around the park. For a minimal fee, you can hop aboard and enjoy a leisurely tour. It's a convenient and fun way to explore every nook and cranny of this expansive wonderland.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the mouthwatering ice cream! There's a delightful selection of flavors, and I couldn't resist treating myself to a scoop. The creamy goodness provided the perfect refresher, and it was the cherry on top of an already fantastic experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Kodomo no kuni is an absolute gem. With its array of slides, expansive playing area, water play, small zoo, boat rides, train-like bus, and delicious ice cream, it's a one-stop destination for endless fun and adventure.

Tama Zoo sets a commendable example by striving to create more natural and explorable environments for its larger animals.\n\nIt was particularly disheartening to see Asian Tropical Forest, given the vast land they have, opt for large parks, play areas, and expansive grassy fields for humans instead of larger enclosures for the animals. I believe the welfare of the animals should always take precedence, which I didn't feel was fully considered given their land use. For instance, there's a large field with a fake elephant enjoying a massive enclosure while the two real elephants share a cramped space (See in my pictures for an example).\n\nI remain hopeful that as laws concerning animal welfare align more closely with global standards and with the resources available to them, Asian Tropical Forest will prioritize creating more animal-friendly environments.", "time": 1720758817, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "9 asias", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117868596545062258392/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW3uEBg_PY-5-iAH4t9OZ8w-XgAwtQAtqEWa7bfiWhwOckrkyQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f #Recommend\n\n- Clean zoo\n- Clean toilet\n- Good atmosphere\n- Friendly staff\n- Food and drinks shop available\n- Most animals are take rest when cold weather\n- Clean walkway\n\n\ud83d\udc2b\ud83e\udd99\ud83e\uddae\ud83e\uddac\ud83e\udd8d\ud83d\udc2a\ud83e\udda7\ud83d\udc06\ud83e\udd98\n\nA Great Way to Spend time with family and friends here.\n\nA great zoo with many animals you would not expect in Colorado, like tigers, elephants, giraffes, and many from warmer climates.\n\nThey also had penguins and grizzly bears.

Very friendly.\n\nVery little English spoken but the exhibits have some English to help and there is a QR guide (I didn't use).  Lots of trains on display from around the world as well as the history of the museums namesake.  It was very cool.  Recommend Google Translate to help where needed.  The hardest part for non Japanese speakers would likely be the ticket purchase.  Tickets are purchased for specific time slots so if they are busy and you just walk up, they may not have tickets but the place was very slow when we visited.\n\nThe diorama room was amazing with different sets of trains running at different times.  Lighting goes through the cycle of the day.  One staffer in this room was very enthusiastic explaining the diorama and all the hidden things and art you can find in it.  He used a translator with great success to explain things.\n\nA slow walk through the exhibits you spend probably about an hour going around (less with impatient kids, more for the enthusiast who wants to take in every detail of the trains).

Paintings from the collections of the National Museums in Kyoto and Nara have been lent to Kanazawa Bunko for this exhibition. The collection of Kanazawa Bunko used to be amazing. It seems that Tokugawa Ieyasu also took Japan's oldest manuscript of the Tale of Genji (Kawachi version), but it has now returned to its original location in Kanazawa Bunko. Additionally, the documents left behind at Shomyo-ji Temple have been designated as national treasures, making me realize once again that it is a valuable facility for Kanagawa Prefecture. I thought it would be a loss if I didn't go to this exhibition, where I could see national treasure-level cultural artifacts in a compact space.

Masamori defected to Soun Hojo, and was attacked by the combined forces of Ogidani and Yamauchi Uesugi, leading to the Battle of Mt. Gongen. This battle is unusual in that Soun loses.\nEven though it is called Mt. Gongen, it is just a small hill. The top is a wide flat area, perhaps the remains of the main castle? (Photos 2-4). There is also a flat area on the north side that looks like a sub-citadel, but I think it was built when the park was created (photos 5 to 7). I think there was also a kuruwa on the south side facing the old Tokaido, but the topography has changed and the details are unknown. Destruction of the ruins had already begun at the end of the Edo period, and when Kanagawa Daiba was being built, a large portion of Mt. Gongen was scraped away and used as land for reclamation.\n\nIt is said that it was once connected to Aoki Castle on the west side along the ridge, but it seems to have been separated by the construction of the Tokaido Line during the Meiji period.
