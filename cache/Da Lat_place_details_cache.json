In the south of the plateau there is Da Lat city. The east and southeast slope down to the Da Nhim river valley, the southwest drops suddenly to the Di Linh plateau. The area is about 1,080 km\u00b2. The terrain is hilly and mountainous with slopes ranging from 8-10\u00b0. There are high peaks here such as Bi Doup (2,287 m), Lang Biang (or Chu Cang Ca, 2,167 m), Hon Giao (2,010 m). River water on the plateau flows slowly; The blocked places spread out into lakes such as Xuan Huong lake, Than Tho lake, Da Thien lake, Dan Kia lake (Suoi Vang), and Cam Ly waterfall. On the edge of the plateau there are large waterfalls such as Pren (Prenn), Gu Ga, Ankr\u00f4et, Voi waterfall. Beautiful scenery, fresh climate suitable for growing temperate vegetables and fruits all year round, with large areas of three-needle pine and five-needle pine forests.\nThe miracle that creates the beauty of the Lang Biang plateau is the typical year-round cool weather and light fog spreading everywhere, making this land even more beautiful and charming. Associated with the Lam Vien Lam Dong plateau is the Lien Khang plateau and the Dran - Phi Nom valley at lower altitudes. Although the base of the plateau is rocky, the topographic surface here has a typical plateau-semi-plateau shape. Lang Biang Plateau has a cool climate, fresh all year round but there is still a rainy season. The rainy season lasts from May to October. During the rainy season, fog often appears, and both valleys and plateaus seem to be covered with a beautiful and mysterious thin film. In particular, this place is known as the paradise of fruits and vegetables. This plateau is suitable for growing fruit trees such as strawberries, plums, oil, radishes, lettuce, artichokes, onions, potatoes...

It's smaller than I expected, but that makes it more intimate. The air is fresh and cool, and the sound of the water is incredibly calming.\n\nThe thing that surprised me most was the \"tourist complex\" vibe. There's an alpine coaster that zooms through the trees, which looked like a blast, but definitely not the peaceful escape I was hoping for. There's also a cable car down to the falls, which is convenient, but takes away from the adventure a bit.

The enclosures seemed kind of small, and some of the puppies seemed a bit tired of all the attention.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they were neglected, but it wasn't quite the free-roaming puppy paradise I was expecting.\n\nAlso, the place is way bigger than it needs to be.  We spent ages walking through these giant fields of flowers that, while pretty, felt a little out of place.  And the line for the strawberry picking was insane!  Maybe it's because we went on a weekend, but it felt less like a farm and more like a theme park with puppies.\n\nOverall, it was a cute way to spend an afternoon, but if you're looking for a genuine farm experience, this might not be it.

We came here from a recommendation from a friend who had already traveled to Vietnam and said it was worth visiting. We were not disappointed. I would not say this is a place to expect great service as they serve hordes of tourists, but you aren\u2019t going for that. You are going for the absolutely wild experience of what I could only imagine Alice in Wonderland felt when she went down the rabbit hole. It is unlikely you will get lost, but it may take you 15-20 minutes to get through to the top if you take your time and lean into the experience. For drinks, we get a double shot of the blended cookies and it gave us a good little buzz as we wandered around.

stumbled on the XQ Art House quite by accident as I was wondering around the super quaint city of Da Lat.  Decided to pay the museum fee and take a peek and oh WOW I am sure glad it did.  What an amazing place.  This is a museum of exquisite fine art like no other I have ever seen. It is filled to the brim with silk embroidery that is so insanely detailed that is is hard to believe they were all hand made. What a labor of love. Some of the art pieces stand 8 feet tall (2.5M) and must contain millions and millions of threads. So detailed that it looks like a high quality photo until you get closer and see the threads.  Shocking is all I can say.  I have a whole new appreciation and respect for the art of embroidery. Aside from the many art pieces, there is an interesting curation from start to finish that takes you on a journey of Vietnamese culture which I found very interesting. This is easily a 2 hour experience, more if you are an art lover as there is just so much to take in here.  I discovered their Saigon location too, which is a mini version of this place, but if you can make it to Da Lat, this is absolutely the epicenter of fine embroidery, perhaps in the whole world.", "time": 1629653917, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Vladimir Losev", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115730191440996604039/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ru", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX1o3RXXIq3jlJ3rn9uWgpL6YGSn8AZ35NDRBRnKlwDFi5f0yTB=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "The most beautiful place!
