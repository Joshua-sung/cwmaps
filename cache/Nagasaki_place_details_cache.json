This peaceful haven, which located in the centre of Nagasaki, promotes peace, understanding, and the elimination of nuclear weapons while acting as a sombre reminder of the catastrophic effects of nuclear war.The famous Peace Statue, a massive bronze sculpture of a man holding up one arm in peace and pointing the other upwards to represent the threat of nuclear weapons, is the focal point of the park. Beautifully designed gardens, peaceful ponds, and meandering walkways encircle the monument, fostering a calm environment that invites introspection and contemplation.A wide range of monuments, memorials, and works of art honouring the remembrance of the Nagasaki atomic attack and the pursuit of peace can be seen all across the park. One of these is the Fountain of Peace, a beautiful monument with messages of hope and reconciliation etched on colourful tiles. The Children's Peace Monument, which honours the youngest bombing victims nearby, has thousands of origami cranes as healing and peaceful symbols.The Nagasaki National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims, a sombre location devoted to remembering those who died in the explosion and conserving their tales for future generations, is among the park's most poignant elements. The memorial hall offers a potent and immersive experience that inspires visitors to consider the human cost of nuclear warfare and the significance of striving towards a world free from the threat of atomic destruction through interactive exhibits, survivor testimonies, and historical artefacts.Apart from its historical and educational importance, Nagasaki Peace Park is a thriving cultural centre that hosts a year-round calendar of events, performances, and activities. The park provides chances for visitors to interact with significant problems and take part in the continuous pursuit of peace, ranging from peace concerts and art exhibitions to talks and symposiums on nuclear disarmament.All things considered, Nagasaki Peace Park is a site of contemplation, healing, and recollection that welcomes travellers from all over the world to respect the memory of the past while pursuing a future full of compassion, understanding, and hope. It is a tribute to the human spirit's tenacity and a ray of hope in a world where the legacy of nuclear bombs still plagues us.", "time": 1711882936, "translated": false}], "user_ratings_total": 7873, "website": "http://www.city.nagasaki.lg.jp/heiwa/3030000/3030100/p005151.html"}, "timestamp": "2024-07-23 16:37:11"}, "ChIJC46vsRChaTURlUoIqR4qlSQ": {"data": {"formatted_address": "Nagasaki, Japan", "name": "Nagasaki"}, "timestamp": "2024-07-23 16:37:15"}, "ChIJ6YXh1kVTFTURzezpL9A_VsE": {"data": {"formatted_address": "Japan, \u3012850-0872 Nagasaki, Teramachi, 4, \uff14\u756a\uff13\uff12\u53f7", "formatted_phone_number": "095-822-1076", "international_phone_number": "+81 95-822-1076", "name": "Kofukuji", "opening_hours": {"open_now": true, "periods": [{"close": {"day": 0, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 0, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 1, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 1, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 2, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 2, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 3, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 3, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 4, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 4, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 5, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 5, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 6, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 6, "time": "0900"}}], "weekday_text": ["Monday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Tuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Wednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Thursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Friday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Saturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Sunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM"]}, "rating": 4.1, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Maria", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110298181878916259176/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXEh0NH7qRvX5-L2cKCYNlee6NLv349jWFEQucL8GZD4mgD3R0k=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "Located in the Teramachi (\u201ctemple\u201d) district, this is the oldest Chinese-style temple in Nagasaki and is designated as an Important Cultural Property.

Texts are all in Japanese, but the audio guides are good and allow to dive into the exhibition.\n\nDetails:\n\nWe came in a little less than 2h before closing time on that day and basically had the whole museum to ourselves. The whole staff greeted us and we felt like on an official state visit. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nThe ticket machines are in Japanese only but the staff will help you if needed. At the entrance another staff member held a sign with English information on playing times for a cinema and a little theater (later more on that).\n\nYou get an audio guide in several languages. German an English are covered. I think Spanish and French as well. The guide is very helpful because texts at the exhibits are nearly all in Japanese. Just choose the number visible at your spot and press play.\n\nThere is little cinema playing a movie that replays the events of the disaster. It is in Japanese, but the audio guide plays translations and explanations in parallel. Worked for me.\n\nEven better is the little theater! It replays the events of the earlier outbreak in 1792 with moving wooden scenery, sound, light and video clips. Made for kids I found myself leaning in totally consumed by the story. Absolutely lovely!\n\nThe do it yourself stations for kids are not fully usable if you don't speak the language. But this is just a minor glitch.\n\nA highlight is the glass floor with a post disaster scenery. Every few minutes it simulates the outbreak and gives you an idea how fast a pyroclastic wave at 100kph really is. Frightening. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nThere is also a volcanic stone walking path and a viewing platform. You could easily spend 4h there, I think. Cafe and vending machines are (of course) available and very affordable.\n\nVery close to the museum is also a set of houses destroyed in the disaster and persevered in their state which gives you an even better understanding of the horrible force that came done back then. No fees charged there.\n\nIf some extra texts in English are added, the place is worth more than 5 stars.\n\nI can only say: VISIT!", "time": 1696224418, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Robert Dykes", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110243561892689165110/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXLB6pQIxUj5I1QvGVL5W3Svqttk58WiwVz2T3azqC_2V-CpFfM=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "10 months ago", "text": "Didn't even know this existed.

The first Tokugawa, Ieyasu, averse to the Portuguese and Spanish missionaries, nevertheless maintained cordial relations with the Lutheran Dutch and Protestant English - on the understanding that they would stay in their lane.\nIeyasu's son, Hidetada, and grandson, Iemitsu, had none of the old man's sentiment towards these foreign interlopers, regardless of denomination, and by 1638 foreigners, with their spouses and children, were being driven to Batavia (Jakarta) and elsewhere.\nTo the building in review; it is a replica of a Dutch factory that was demolished, in the early 1640s in accordance with Iemitsu's \"locked country\" policy. Around that time the Dutch were shipped out to Dejima, Nagasaki, where they were, to all intents and purposes, incarcerated for almost 250 years.\nThe building itself is pleasant enough and its museum contains a few artifacts of note; excavated items and those dredged out of the harbour. Here you can learn a very superficial history of the Dutch in Hirado.\nWhy do I give this only three stars? In my opinion, the museum represents a missed opportunity. In 1613, four years after the Dutch, until bankruptcy a mere ten years later, the English established a trading post lead by cape (head) factor Richard Cocks, and William \"Miura Anjin\" Adams. The ensuing Anglo-Dutch rivalry, endured by the hapless Cocks and instigated by his Dutch counterpart Jacques Spex, is worthy of a Hollywood trilogy. These capers, a sort of John Le Carre meets Errol Flynn meets Jack Sparrow, as seen through the eyes of a merchant whose bookkeeping was frequently defeated by his own ledger, are noteworthy contributions to the history of Hirado, and yet this narrative is curiously omitted from the museum.\nFortunately for us, Richard Cocks left behind his diary and a collection of letters to read (they are freely available on the internet). So, by all means visit and get your snaps for social media. Then go and read the back story to the Dutch and English traders in Hirado.

I would suggest to arrive as soon as you can, around 16 o'clock animals are getting ready to go home and sleep (official closing time is 17:00, but actually it starts around 16:15 - different animals go home at different times). Also some animals you can feed only before a certain hour such as monkeys (11:00 to 15:00). And for some other animals vegetables/ other food may be sold out already due to the limited amount. Sooner is better there, I wish we would know that in advance.\n\nYou will spend 2 hours there minimum, I would suggest to plan with 3-4h, 4h would be ideal. Also take a lot of 100yen coins, you would need them for purchasing food for animals - 10-15x 100y coins for a person would be ideal.\n\nYou can touch a lot of animals here - at your own risk, but they are calm (and feed them). Such as flamingos, capybaras, kangaroos, monkeys, lemurs and racoons (you can touch just their paws while feeding them).\n\nIt's really a unique experience. Animals there are well cared for, clean, happy.\n\nI would rather support this amazing place than some cafe where animals have never seen dirt before.\n\nOne tip: If you feel like it you can feed the animals from your hand. Put your fingers together and open your hand fully. Then place the treat in middle of your palm.

You can pet inus (dogs), nekos (cats), guinea pigs, goats, rabbits, and squirrel monkeys! The staff was also very cheerful - you can feel how much they care for the animals.\n\nIt was different from the other zoos because you can actually see the animals up close, interact with them and feed them. You have to prepare a lot of coins. The highlight for me would be the capybara zone. They were sleeping when we arrived so we went back. I also enjoyed the raccoons (lol). They were super cute. And lastly Momo the hippo. She was sleeping when we arrived. We waited for a while until she woke up. You can feed her cabbage and this will make her happy.

There are two places where you have to climb up using your hands, and three places where you have to pass ropes or chains. I climbed in the season when the temperature was around 20\u2103, but I was sweating. I think you should bring your own drinks.\nThe view from the top of the mountain is quite nice \ud83d\ude46\ud83d\ude46\ud83d\ude46", "time": 1621982402, "translated": true}], "user_ratings_total": 44, "website": "http://www.kawatana.jp/kankou/pickup/index.html"}, "timestamp": "2024-07-23 16:39:08"}, "ChIJg29zz7msajURNiJRoTHDsl4": {"data": {"formatted_address": "2 Chome-252 Nishiyama, Nagasaki, 850-0001, Japan", "formatted_phone_number": "095-829-1184", "international_phone_number": "+81 95-829-1184", "name": "Konpira Park", "opening_hours": {"open_now": true, "periods": [{"open": {"day": 0, "time": "0000"}}], "weekday_text": ["Monday: Open 24 hours", "Tuesday: Open 24 hours", "Wednesday: Open 24 hours", "Thursday: Open 24 hours", "Friday: Open 24 hours", "Saturday: Open 24 hours", "Sunday: Open 24 hours"]}, "rating": 4, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Antonina", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117269624330155575248/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUvlpFUTar21Jvvlrb-p57aaauiZhfeTFSudng0vB2_Da6ftQP8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "Amazing for sunset but it's hard to get there.

However, I couldn't find it because it was full of bushes, and after going around three quarters of the way around the Chureito Pagoda, I came to a cliff (cut bank) and when I tried to go down to the moat (koshikuruwa) at the bottom of the cliff, I got flustered and slipped. The relative height was about 3 to 4 meters, so I rotated sideways once and finally stopped. Fortunately, I was not injured and my body was still moving. I was injured on the first day of my 5-night, 6-day trip, but I couldn't fully regret it... I thanked God.\nI gave up on the third kuruwa and headed for the second kuruwa along this moat. The second corner is a plaza, and there is an old ``Sanjo Castle Information Board'' here. From here, I headed towards San-no-Kuruwa along a narrow road, and halfway down the slope (where there are stone wall remains), I found a side road on the left that was overgrown with weeds.
