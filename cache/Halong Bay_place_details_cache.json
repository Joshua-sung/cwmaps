We did the 2 day 1 night.\nWe were upgraded twice from our original room and ultimately ended up in the captains quarters room. The room is the best part of the cruise, without a doubt. The full floor to ceiling window and sliding door to your private balcony  is breathtaking. Bathtub with a sea view was also mesmerizing and a huge bonus. Waking up with that view  is worth the price of admission (which is not cheap we paid $500 for our 2 day 1 night stay).\n\nHaving said this, for the price tag there are a couple points worth noting. English from the staff is almost non existent, as to be expected in Vietnam. Apart from our lovely cruise director and host who is super accommodating. The activities (kayaking, Muay Thai) were great, we really enjoyed these.\n\nNow for the kicker. The food and drink are a bit rough. The welcome buffet was excellent. Local plates, lots of variety, fresh and I can\u2019t speak highly enough about it. From there you kayak for a few hours and the next meal isn\u2019t until cocktail hour which was underwhelming after such a nice lunch. Fries, some fruit, but nothing to really hold you over until dinner which is not until 7:30pm.\n\nDinner was\u2026I hate to say this, rough. I would have preferred some local Vietnamese dishes and I think the chefs would do a better job with this than trying to serve \u201cluxury\u201d western plates.\n\nMy last comment is on the cocktails.

You can do squid fishing or watching movies at night. For those who enjoys exercise, Taichi is offered in early morning when you can also watch sunrise which is a very nice experience.\nStaffs are extremely nice and attentive.

However, to our great disappointment, we found out that in the rain (even a light drizzle), the rides and the water park do not operate. Our tickets were for Dragon Park, which, according to the managers, was not working. Why is it possible to buy tickets to an amusement park that is not operational?! Why mislead people by selling tickets to a park that does not function properly?\n\nThere was no one at the entrance, and we spent a long time trying to find staff. An elderly woman yelled at us in Vietnamese, which we do not understand. No one could explain to us that the park does not operate in the rain. Eventually, someone took us to the reception.\n\nAt the reception, no one could clearly explain why the rides do not operate in light rain, yet tickets are still being sold. The staff barely spoke English. No solution was offered until I suggested exchanging our tickets for any existing and working attraction or entertainment.

The tour operator normally provides pick up and drop off to and from the hotel in Hanoi Old Quarter. The daytour comes with English or Vietnamese speaking guide. The Halong Bay trip will start in the midday from Ha Long City Marina with lunch at the boat. The tour will have three stops: Suprise Cove, Lan Ha Bay, and Ti Top island.

Food served at the boat is delicious.\n\nI suggest you order or upgrade your lunch to buffet lunch. The buffet spread is good. Some fresh seafood: prawn and shells are served with soup, bread, rice and some Vietnamese dishes. The beverages must be ordered separately with additional costs.

Locals realized that and for an \"access fee\" about 500.000 Dong they got me through their house and helped with the steep climb to get access to the stairs.\nAttention! At first: obviously illegal. At second: fit people only. No overweight, not for weak persons, not for people with vertigo, heart diseases or breath issues. Just \"do not try at home\". If something happen: there is no access for anyone with a stretcher. You would need an helicopter.\n\nHalf of the ascend are stairs. Quite weathered, some fell apart but towards the peak just a rocky path. No, not a cobblestone way. Boulders. Overgroving green, old leaves make it unsecure and unobvious. Cautious steps needed. Your thighs had happier situations before only and your lungs are thinking about to go somewhere else for an easier job.\n\nYes, the view is amazing. No wonder this place got this name. Really inspiring. If you ask me was it worth it: yes, a real adventure.\nHowever, today we can use drones. No place you have to find to operate; you can do everywhere else (however, I have no idea about how-to operate in a legal way). They even offer individual flights over the Halong Bay area.\n\nI had to go down soon as the sun was about to go down. At least my breath was more silent now. I missed the spot where my ascend joined the official path. Here I found the reason why it is closed. Apparently a rockslide cut off the stairs. A house high. Even if you could bribe the guard at the official entrance - He could not do anything to get you up.\nSo I had to turn back to find the trail I got here.\n\nBack down I was wet from sweat, dirty and relieved.\nThe conclusion: even if the view is breathtaking: it is too dangerous. If something happen those helping people could get real difficuties, not just that injured person.\nUse a drone - way more versatile, take the flight or that cable car. Great view, no danger and in the last case a beautiful amusement park awaits you. Ah, and that park has a real tall ferris wheel.\nThe mountain access need a full revamp, repair and modernisation and for the upper part stairs had to be created. Which would be a big investment. As the tip is used by a communication company: that installation is not safe for visitors Even this one has to be renewed at all.\nI do not see it could be open soon at all.\n\nA last note: as I used my time after work I had too narrow time constraints.

It\u2019s not appropriate for the otherwise white-glove level of formal setting they have.  I queried why this was happening and requested they just turn down the bass and they said they would \u201cafter the presentation\u201d and didn\u2019t.  I\u2019m unsure why you would play pumped up bass heavy music at 7:15am in the morning that can even be heard in the rooms.  When the music wasn\u2019t bass heavy it was still questionable as to the type of ambience they wanted to set and myself, my brother and father all at different occasions commented that the music was a poor choice.  I think it\u2019s very easy to put on relaxing/appropriate music that would suit most and this wasn\u2019t it. The fact I gave them that feedback and they couldn\u2019t alternate it was an easy win that they lost.\n\nMy father also was unhappy to find honey teas and sparkling waters that were offered during meal services and seemingly included in the bill were in fact additional charges.\n\nEmergency/assistance contact overnight was not communicated effectively enough.  The emergency contact is to dial 222 however this was said once during the opening speech and what I thought was said was to *go* to room 222.  Ok I misunderstood and I bare some responsibility for that but I only had one opportunity to take in this important information and had no idea I had not understood it correctly until I needed it and it was too late and no-one was around to ask.  I was very unwell in the middle of the night and had to wander around an empty ship unable to find room 222 (my room was 201 so the assumption is it would be close and on the same level) and went on to have a mild panic attack as I felt like I was going to pass out from heat exhaustion.  This was followed by bouts of diarrhoea which I cannot blame them for but I suspect may have been due to the ice in drinks I had.  It is not their fault I was unwell, even if it was the ice, but they were completely unable to help me and left me in a vulnerable and potentially embarrassing situation.\n\nLater in the morning at about 7:00am I approached a staff member in the breakfast area and advised I had been unwell and wanted assistance and if they had any medication that would settle my stomach.  The staff said he would get someone else to help, asked for my room number and advised I could return to my room.  Well over an hour has passed and I heard nothing further.  Unbelievable and unforgivable.  I am still sitting in the room recovering as I write this.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nSeperate to all this - special shout out to the waiter whose name I think was Nani?
