However, 7 books depicted the Great Wall as far as North Pyeongan Province and South Pyeongan Province, and 29 volumes depicted the Great Wall as far as Sinuiju and the Amnok River(Yalu River).\n\nToday, 15 years after the Northeast Project (2002-2007), China has removed the traces of Goguryeo Bakjak Fortress near Amnok River from the world history textbooks published by famous publishers around the world, and had built Hushan Fortress on the zone, stubbornly insisting that the fortress belongs to the Great Wall.\n\nWhat is more serious is that the Great Wall of China is a representative cultural heritage of China that is essentially introduced in famous world history textbooks.\n\nIn these world history textbooks, stories about the Great Wall and Emperor Qin Shi Huang are all introduced, but China is secretly stealing the history of Goguryeo and Balhae of Korea using the Great Wall, which is their representative cultural heritage.\n\nIf we cannot stop the Chinese government from extorting the history of Goguryeo and Balhae through the Great Wall, in the near future, teenagers worldwide will naturally perceive the history of Goguryeo and Balhae as Chinese history.\n\nAmerican World History textbooks, in particular, are studied by American junior high students. and the distorted perception of history acquired in junior high can have a major impact on them as they become adults.\n\nAmerican textbooks are revised every six years, and California textbooks in particular were revised in 2016 and will be done again in 2022. Accordingly, VANK will inform publishers of the distorted history of the Great Wall not only for California, but throughout the United States, and work on revisions.\n\nTherefore, VANK intends to expand Chinas distortion of the Great Wall not only as a problem of Korea and China, but also to China and other countries around the world.", "time": 1625277941, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Grey kim", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113124337684496914686/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ko", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUwl6iZBGVRMwHKlj-LYoaj2chkYFMouvTqX5WLeKh0xMUzWK0=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "It's a mystery, it's not a great castle", "time": 1715252610, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "Young-sun Mo", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117314034709097717304/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ko", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjULRyMtqdOQdlBXq1m0ZvuuIyqq_xHFfgtKPL3subyPaIS6trs=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "Bisaseong, the beginning of Goguryeo's thousand-ri wall", "time": 1564235233, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "hiro Suzuki", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104502715507132553000/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLcLV3UmbytCQBj8PIxKVOCWgMdhvLb6Wvtt8Zz5000Hlt8pw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "", "time": 1568784798, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "SPT SPD", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110967113578324642237/reviews", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjW7PBoASZUxAeGALi-Yg3KtvVyezo-Xlcz7o35MEZXoueYt2vK-=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "", "time": 1666702097, "translated": false}], "user_ratings_total": 7}, "timestamp": "2024-07-15 11:21:15"}, "ChIJW0rsNlQLjzURQobDZ_ovBLo": {"data": {"formatted_address": "China, Liao Ning Sheng, Da Lian Shi, Lv Shun Kou Qu, \u9ec4\u6cb3\u8def\u5c3d\u5934 \u90ae\u653f\u7f16\u7801: 116041", "formatted_phone_number": "0411 8662 2735", "international_phone_number": "+86 411 8662 2735", "name": "\u65c5\u987a\u519b\u6e2f\u516c\u56ed", "rating": 4.7, "reviews": [{"author_name": "KC Ho", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108113820948575057058/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "zh-Hant", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX0UsJp-aybE57iLhWZRaPWZCtzdOBlPmr2pmW5hbzNBpCj_Xgo5w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 years ago", "text": "The park is not big, but facing the entrance and exit of Lushun Port is only 190 meters wide.

Since I went on a holiday, there were a lot of families with children, and as you might expect from coming to a museum with children, many of them looked like intellectuals and were intelligent. This modern history seems to be a permanent exhibit, but as a Japanese person, I felt a little overwhelmed by the depictions of Japanese people doing cruel things to Chinese people. However, since it is a city with a large number of Japanese people, I don't think the local people have any bad feelings towards Japanese people as it is an exhibition of past history.
