An elderly woman mistakenly wrote the stamp of Enko Daishi's 25 Sacred Sites in her stamp book.\nWhen I asked him why, he didn't tell me which goshuin, so he said he wrote one of the 25 sacred sites, which he often writes about.\nIt's probably wrong that I didn't mention it, but if there are two types of goshuin, what kind of goshuin should the elderly person write here? I thought I should have asked, and I should have listed the types of goshuin stamps as an example.\nIn the end, someone else came and talked with them, and they ended up forcibly stamping the seal of the 25 Sacred Sites with the Mitsuba Aoi seal, and they apologized.\nThe money was taken without incident.\nIn 90% of other shrines and temples, if you make a mistake, they won't charge you for the stamp.\nI got a Reana Goshuin stamp, but a little lump remained.\nMost temples display the types of stamps at the reception desk, so I think this temple should follow suit.\nVisit 2024.4.23", "time": 1714076295, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "a m", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104382973349188538022/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ja", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX1NlRDHkPN_Afjb_RfxtzsZc7Z55KvyEhicCnfBREOBwfnQdwh3g=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "It's a very beautiful and quiet temple.
