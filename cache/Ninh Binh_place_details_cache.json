If you want to go straight to the boat ride, please see the other reviews. I rented a scooter for my beautiful lady and I, and this review is from that perspective. We rode in no boats, although we did see a bus load of tourists in line to do just that. We were hot with a 50 km breeze of our creating. I cannot imagine what they felt breeze-free. 103 degrees, even in the shade you will be sweating profusely. I rented the scooter in Ninh Binh and it takes about 30 minutes with no stops. We stopped in many places along the way and even a quaint village adjacent to Van Long. At Van Long, we hiked our own trail, saw beautiful birds and butterflies. We even spotted a snake slicing atop the water (it's Vietnam). If I had the choice again,  I would do it the same way. The bird? A Gray-headed Swamphen, a first for me.", "time": 1714983228, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Michaela Lan Nguyenov\u00e1", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115071328019908414032/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVPj30TlUdvwXIsW-VcNezWaSq0oyzTpFxonruCbZtHltCwE27h=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "5 months ago", "text": "(September 2023)\nSomeone from the restaurant near the parking area pointed us to the point where you could buy the tickets for the boat, it was a few meters away from the \u201cpier\u201d.

The ticket price is 250k per person or 500k for a private boat if you are a single. Otherwise you can have up to 4 people (I think) on a boat but it\u2019s still 250k per person. The ticket price includes an electric shuttle from the ticket office to the starting point and back.\n\nThe ticket price also includes as many stops along the river as you like BUT if you don\u2019t tell the boat driver, they won\u2019t make any stops. Without stops the total time up and down the river is a little less than 1.5 hours.\n\nThere are about 4 potentially interesting stops along the river. I suggest stopping at the end for a short walk, as it\u2019s nice to stretch the legs and walk over a few beautiful bridges. The water is also cleanest there. The other stop you ABSOLUTELY MUST make is Gioi Ravine. You\u2019ll see a sign for it along the river, before entering the second cave. It\u2019s a short 5-10 minute walk through narrow rocks but it\u2019s vertical and up stairs the entire way. At the top is the most beautiful viewpoint, it\u2019s top 3 best places we\u2019ve seen in Vietnam. So many boats passed this stop and it\u2019s a shame because this is a MUST do.\n\nThere is only one route up and back, you\u2019ll pass beautiful rice paddies and go through 3 caves in a nice looking boat as you\u2019re towed along the river by the drivers feet. I strongly suggest you bring an umbrella to protect from the sun and water because it gets hot! There was only shade in the caves and at stopping points along the river. We went around 10am in May and it wasn\u2019t too crowded on the river, maybe a bit on the way back.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to point out the boat drivers are paid with your ticket price, so I don\u2019t understand why people are suggesting you tip. Most boat drivers will try to sell you artwork or similar towards the end and they will strongly suggest you tip them. This was the only negative for us, as our driver demanded we tip her for the last 5 minutes of the trip. Tipping is not customary in Vietnam so we did not tip, and I\u2019m from the US. Of course feel free to tip if you like but you definitely shouldn\u2019t feel required to and it definitely shouldn\u2019t be demanded by the drivers.

It is beautiful, even in foggy weather, but looks as newly built (like bigger bigger biggest in mind?). There are 6 ticket options, of which the most extensive one will take you 4 hours to see everything. We took option 1, of which the ending was a long walk back to the electrical car that drives you back to a super large, newly built (not finished yet) parking lot, which is rather industrial looking , and truly mega large in set up. It's not my taste, and I guess in high season, I think this means it will be super super bussy.\n\nWhat I found difficult is that with ticket selling, they have ladies that know some english and try to get you the more expensive options of tickets, but you don't really know where you are paying for. The complex is rather large, so we choose option 1.\n\nPoint which I hope will change / improve sooner than later: large groups, lead by a guide that is shouting through a carry on amplifier / speaker, which is deafening as bystander or just passing when passing along. And also a lot of others, in these groups, are more shouting than talking towards each other. Doesn't look aggressive, but it is more than just loud talking.

L was very knowledgeable about the primates (we started the tour with a visit at the primates rescue center) and the species present in the park. The hike through the forest was very cool, we even saw the king Cobra! We hiked for 4 hours until we reached a small stream where we set up the camp. There were really a lot of leeches, so be prepared for that. Lang was born in the primary forest and he was very skilled about life in the forest. For instance, he collected bamboo rots and cooked them inside the bamboo on the fire. We ate dinner and then we went for 1h of night spotting but we didn't see much other than a few spiders. The morning after the hike lasted only 1h, until we reached the main road, where our car was already waiting for us. I would have liked the second day to be a bit longer.
