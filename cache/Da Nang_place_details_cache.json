The staff were nice and helpful. The beach was very wide, spacious and clean. Although the sea was quite wavy in most days, it was nice to enjoy the sun on the beach. The pool was nice, they clean it constantly. The whole resort is really peaceful. Even though it\u2019s busy, you hardly see other people walking around. They offer free breakfast; it is okay even though they kept messing up our eggs lol. The hotel is quite close to both Danang and Hoian so it is easy to commute to either.

No water, juice or towels were offered which I saw given to guests checking in at the main lobby.\n\nWe came back at 2pm and were taken by buggy to our villa.

It was good value, especially with the free flow wine option, but there were two problems. The center table of fresh live seafood you can have prepared to your liking was not explained to us and there was almost never a server there to help.
