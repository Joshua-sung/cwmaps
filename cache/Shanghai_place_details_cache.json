It's morals and ethics were suspect -- perhaps like some of us view Las Vegas.\nThe signs would read like, \"Here in Shanghai in 1883, the first modern waterworks in all of Asia was built by the capitalist running dog imperialist forces from England.\" and\n\"Here we see a model of the first electrical lighting system complete with streetlights built by the European Imperialist Capitalist Running Dogs in 1884.\"\nThere were revealing photos of a bank building with a sign in English carved into the stone edifice reading,\"The Japanese Bank of Tai-Wan\" with a detailed history of the imperialist Japanese and the modern banking system they introduced and how the bank personal were overworked and lead to the first strike by workers in China.\nIt was all very thought provoking.

It owes its special social attractions and rich commercial background to the fact that the earliest bank, gold shop, jeweler's store, wine shop and tea house of the city were all to be found here.\n\nThe architecture and the layout of shops in Shanghai Old Street show its development that began during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) until the period when European influence made an impact on the city. The western part of this old street begins at South Henan Road and continues to Guanyi Street. The buildings here reflect the style of the Ming and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties and the architecture is elegant in its classic simplicity. Red poles, pink walls and black roofs with upswept eaves are in harmony with the buildings in Yu Garden. The eastern end of Shanghai Old Street, with a length of 500 meters (about 1,640 feet) ends at Renmin Road and after reconstruction and decoration retains the residential characteristics of later Qing Dynasty. The swing doors reach to the ground, the lattice windows and the graceful roofs with upswept eaves are fascinating as they are precisely how foreigners imagine China to be. Although there are several European buildings, they don't contradict the styles of old Shanghai. On the contrary, they are a vital part of the diverse culture here.\nThere are about 225 stores on  Shanghai Old Street, each designed carefully according to its function. Shops purveying handicraft articles, paintings, calligraphies and jewelry are well-appointed and give you plenty of variety from which to choose what you want. On the eastern part, old shops such as the Tong Han Chun Pharmacy, Lao Tong Sheng Food Store, Wu Liang Cai Glass Shop, De Shun restaurant, take you back to the Shanghai of 100 years ago. In the Chun Feng De Yi Lou teahouse, you can enjoy Yuanbao Tea served with two olives in it. On weekends, the Pingtan (Suzhou Ballads) are performed here too. In the Old Tea House, the owner has on display a collection of fifty cheongsams, traditionally styled ladies dresses, dating from the 1930s. By contrast at the western end of the street is where items of folk culture may be bought. The antique shops, embroidery houses and wonderful fabric shops symbolize the commercial prosperity of the area.", "time": 1700921377, "translated": false}], "user_ratings_total": 494}, "timestamp": "2024-07-09 11:11:35"}, "ChIJGd_06nFwsjURGkunaspI9RA": {"data": {"formatted_address": "374 Huang Pi Nan Lu, Huang Pu Qu, Shang Hai Shi, China, 200002", "formatted_phone_number": "021 5383 2171", "international_phone_number": "+86 21 5383 2171", "name": "Site of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party", "opening_hours": {"open_now": true, "periods": [{"close": {"day": 0, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 0, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 2, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 2, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 3, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 3, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 4, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 4, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 5, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 5, "time": "0900"}}, {"close": {"day": 6, "time": "1700"}, "open": {"day": 6, "time": "0900"}}], "weekday_text": ["Monday: Closed", "Tuesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Wednesday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Thursday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Friday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Saturday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM", "Sunday: 9:00\u202fAM\u2009\u2013\u20095:00\u202fPM"]}, "rating": 3.9, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Dominic Lee", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106517941138467622120/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWVeBlhGLkXJHsJwQ8CCGO351Y2UCbJsV5FQX0EDAgUEMalOh2R=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba8", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "3 years ago", "text": "An interesting place to visit if you like politics & history, gives an insight (albeit heavily skewed) to the Chinese revolution.

The tower's interior seamlessly combines traditional Chinese design elements with contemporary touches, creating a sophisticated ambiance.\n\nRiding the express elevators to the observation deck on the 88th floor is a thrilling experience, offering panoramic views of the sprawling cityscape, the Huangpu River, and the neighboring skyscrapers. The architectural ingenuity is evident in the tower's structural design, incorporating advanced engineering to withstand earthquakes and typhoons common to the region.\n\nOne of the Jin Mao Tower's unique features is its multi-functional nature. Housing a luxury hotel, offices, and observation decks, it serves as a microcosm of urban living, making it a symbol of Shanghai's economic and cultural dynamism. The tower's integration of sustainable practices further underscores its commitment to environmental responsibility.\n\nIn summary, the Jin Mao Tower is more than a towering structure; it's a testament to architectural innovation, cultural fusion, and urban functionality.

Both ladies speak pretty good English and were more than helpful, really taking their time with me, even though other customers walked in. I guess when you treat people as people, with respect, and not just as sales persons, then you can expect to be treated the same way. They were so helpful even after the sale, one accompanying me all the way in that big mall to a shoe store that she recommended (they didn't have my size for the shoes where the shoe size is printed on them, like the picture) and the other lady walking me through the maze to a clean rest room.
