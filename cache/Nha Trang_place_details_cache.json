Just cross the bridge and a more enjoyable world unfolds.\n\nActually, the reason Koreans go to Southeast Asian night markets is for food, snacks, and fun? The downtown night market that many Koreans go to doesn\u2019t have that. This place is completely local, and it's clean. Of course the price is cheap!!!!\n\nThe portions aren't very large, so you can order a variety of items and receive a receipt, so it's a good idea to bring cash and enjoy delicious food and the local life. There are so many babies and puppies, so cute haha\nBetween 6 and 7 o'clock, locals with children come and have food and drinks, and there are a few Russians.\n\nIt's a night market built in a park, so come around 5:30 before sunset and take pictures. When the night market opens at 6, find a good spot to eat, drink beer and drinks, and when the DJ plays a song around 7:30, you can look around and take a Grab.\n\nWhen I found a spot I liked, Mr. Wen came and I thought he was trying to solicit customers, so I was annoyed, but he was just a friendly person who took the drink order delivered and cleaned up the place. Sorry for being here \u3160\u3160\nIt seems like the seats are divided into sections, but you can order food from all over and eat it all in one place. Most people don't seem to understand English, but there is a Korean menu that is strangely translated through a translator. Everyone is friendly anyway, so you can order everything with a wave of your hand.\n\nRecommended menu.\nA store selling snail dishes. Flavored clams, conches, flower snails, and especially the Thai-style clam stew tastes 100% authentically Thai, making me wonder if it's Vietnam or Thailand. Good good. Feel free to order a variety of products.\nBan Xeo. I added all the pork belly, shrimp, bean sprouts, and squid and ate it with vegetables and sauce.

He is remembered as the co-discoverer of the bacillus responsible for the bubonic plague or pest, which was later named in his honour: Yersinia pestis. Another bacteriologist, the Japanese physician Kitasato Shibasabur\u014d, is often credited with independently identifying the bacterium a few days earlier, but may have identified a different bacterium and not the pathogen-causing plague.

We knew our ticket included a free drop off van ride to our hotel. The taxi drivers crowded the exit of the bus, making it hard to move as they repeatedly shouted \"Taxi\" and we responded No we're taking the drop off van from Futa we paid for! We informed several other bus riders that their ticket includes free drop off, and they thanked us because they were about to pay for a taxi. We asked the assistant bus driver where to go to wait for the free gray van to our hotel and he said to take a taxi because there's no free van! Taxi drivers bombarded us when he said that. We knew that wasn't right, so we broke thru the crowd of taxi drivers and all went where the Vietnamese people were waiting. Sure enough, friendly Futa employees asked us what hotel we we're getting dropped off at and got us all on the free van. Futa should ensure they inform their customers they get a free drop off. Maybe have an English language sign on the bus by the seat chart. This kind of behavior by the Futa assistant bus driver and the Taxi drivers will continue to leave tourists with a bad impression of Futa and Vietnam. I hope Futa fixes this.\n\nThe process was otherwise good. Ticket purchase was easy and friendly enough. Bus ride felt safer than the ride to Da Lat with a different company.  Sleeper beds were comfy for the 4 hours. Air conditioning worked well. They gave a free bottle of water. There was a stop for 20 minutes to use the bathroom and eat.

In Nha Trang, Vietnam, this grand cathedral has an interesting quirk. Upon entering, you encounter a donation box, which globally means a container to receive voluntary donations. However, the gatekeeper at the entrance demands 10,000 VND for entry. Google Maps reviews are flooded with complaints about this 'gatekeeper' extorting entry fees. In Vietnam, while you can report forced charges to the police, who would waste their time for about 0.5 USD? I obediently paid the 'ticket' fee, hoping to complain to the church staff or priest, only to find that the gatekeeper speaks the best English in the entire cathedral. So how can a mere complaint resolve this? Why not just boldly rename the church to 'Nha Trang Cathedral Museum'?\n\n\u2705My visit to Nha Trang Cathedral was fraught with difficulties. On the first day, I arrived on a Sunday and was told by the gatekeeper that entry was at 10:00 due to worship. I visited another site and returned at around 12:00, only to find that it reopened at 14:00. Maps indicated that the cathedral has a daily lunch break. So, is it the 'divine' resting or the gatekeeper needing a nap?\n\n\u2705The next day, I returned dressed in a tank top and long pants, but was stopped again, being told I needed to cover my shoulders and arms. I went back to the hotel for a shawl and returned, only to face the gatekeeper's grin and the forced ticket fee situation. There seems to be no 'divine,' only the gatekeeper exercising his supreme power, indulging and enjoying it.", "time": 1719848052, "translated": false}], "user_ratings_total": 1750}, "timestamp": "2024-07-31 12:58:20"}}
