I stayed at the KK Sapa Hotel, which provided a luxurious and comfortable base for my explorations. The hotel is beautifully situated on a hill, offering panoramic views of the surrounding mountains.\n\nDuring the day, I immersed myself in the rich culture and stunning landscapes of Sa Pa. The local markets were a treasure trove of handicrafts, textiles, and souvenirs. One of the highlights was a guided trek through the terraced rice fields and nearby villages, which you can see in the photos. The scenery was breathtaking, and it was fascinating to learn about the local way of life and the customs of the ethnic minority communities. Visiting Cat Cat Village provided a deeper understanding of the traditional lifestyles and crafts of the Hmong people.\n\nWhen the sun set, Sa Pa Town transformed into a lively hub of activity. The nightlife was vibrant and diverse, offering a range of bars and clubs to explore. A standout experience was visiting \"AMG Lounge\" a club with an energetic atmosphere, lively music, and a friendly crowd. The mix of locals and tourists created a fun and welcoming environment, perfect for dancing the night away and making new friends. The vibrant lights and excellent selection of drinks added to the excitement, making it a night to remember.\n\nThe culinary scene in Sa Pa was another highlight of my trip. I had the chance to savor a variety of local dishes, from street food stalls to the hotel\u2019s upscale restaurant. The flavors were rich and unique, reflecting the local ingredients and culinary traditions. I particularly enjoyed thang co, a traditional Hmong soup, and grilled skewers from the night market. Dining at the hotel\u2019s restaurant was also a treat, with delicious meals enjoyed against the backdrop of misty mountains.\n\nMy stay in Sa Pa Town was an unforgettable experience filled with adventure, relaxation, and fun.

Among the few surviving structures are the Stone Church, Hoang Lien Hotel, and the Sapa Tourism Information Centre. Nestled at 1,500 meters above sea level and over 300 km from Hanoi, Sapa remained secluded and underdeveloped during French colonial rule, resulting in the absence of European architectural influences.\n\nInitially used sparingly for religious worship, this church began services in 1935, paused during the Japanese occupation (1940-1945), and resumed until 1954. After a period of disuse, restoration efforts began in 1995, softening strict regulations and revitalizing the church for worship.\n\nInside, the church's interior is a vibrant contrast to its rugged exterior. White, yellow, and brown tones from varnished wood dominate the space. 32 stained glass windows, depicting biblical scenes, adorn the walls. Among regional churches, Sapa's Stone Church stands out, offering a unique experience.\n\nWhat's fascinating is the congregation, primarily from the local minority ethnic groups, notably the Hmong. Situated in Sapa's main square, this church hosts diverse events, including the renowned Saturday night Love Markets.\n\nOnce a tradition for hill tribes to find partners from different villages, the Love Markets symbolize a bygone era. Though the practice has dwindled, visitors can still witness performances that once played a role in uniting young individuals from various communities.\n\nThe Stone Church, an emblem of Sapa's history, not only represents architectural heritage but also stands as a testimony to cultural traditions that have evolved over time.\n\n\ud83d\udccd Notre Dame Cathedral\n\ud83d\ude99 H\u00e0m R\u1ed3ng, TT.

This is a good hotel with inconsistencies that can easily be fixed. The largest disappointment came from being refused late checkout in a hotel that was very empty (housekeeping leaves all the rooms open as they clean them, and we were practically the only guests in the hotel). The hotel manager gave no logic for refusing late checkout but did offer us tea and to use a shower after checkout.\n\nRoom: Had a soft and comfortable bed, a safe, balcony, and fridge. The room itself was a five star room, however the bathroom had a dirty towel folded up as if it was clean when we arrived. See attached photo; it looks like it was used to kill bugs and then folded up and placed back in the bathroom. This was a nasty surprise but can be easily avoided as this was a very clean hotel otherwise. Toiletry bottles were mini and not full.The hair drier in 302 did not work and is dangerous as it heats up and short circuits because the fan function within it is not working. Basically a toaster.\n\nBreakfast: Highlight of the property. Had the chicken noodle soup both mornings with very fresh fruit. Eggs also an option. The coffee is much stronger than other local coffees we tried brewed in the same local fashion, and could have used a bit less ground in it.\n\nArea: Good spot which is up the hill away from the main strip leading to more quiet but also more walking to get to things. Close to Sapa Station. Our tour guide explained Sa Pa is a town developed rapidly for exploitation of the natural environment and the Indigenous areas around it and is thus not well integrated into its surroundings. There is constant construction and the architecture is not unique or authentic to the region. We will stay in a mountainside hotel instead of a hotel in town next time.\n\nAccessibility: No elevator and slippery walkway to get to entrance. I would not recommend this hotel for people with mobility issues.\n\nValue: One of the more expensive hotels we stayed at in Vietnam however Sa Pa is more expensive due to a real estate boom and its rural location up a mountain.", "time": 1687852029, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Enar Kraav", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109144386743984138941/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVDnX1T6wMc3IjW_qhRMjdBz0EpSvEtlx-DsT6NH3IngoX2aqw=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "One of the highlights of our stay was the hotel staff.

Additionally, they kept our baggage after check-out, which made our last day in Sa Pa more convenient. They also assisted us in ordering a bus ticket to Hanoi, which was cheaper compared to the internet prices.\n\nIn terms of amenities, the hotel provided a good breakfast selection that satisfied our morning appetite. The availability of a heat pump for both heating and cooling was convenient, ensuring that we were comfortable regardless of the weather outside. Wi-Fi connection was also reliable.\n\nDuring our stay, it happened to be Christmas time, and the hotel invited us to join their family Christmas dinner. This was an unexpected gesture that made us feel welcomed and added a special touch to our vacation. The homemade dinner food was rich and flavourful, and it was a delightful experience to celebrate the holiday with the hotel staff and their loved ones as we were far away from our families.\n\nThis hotel is certainly worth considering if you're looking for a budget-friendly option with friendly service and a cosy atmosphere.

Feels really peaceful and quiet there and the beds are really comfy. Breakfast was nice, I had banana pancakes and my partner had an omelette.\n\nThe view from the rooms was amazing. However, we got a lot of bugs in our room in the evening, despite keeping the doors and windows shut. We wore bug spray and it seemed to be fine.\n\nOnly thing I would say to be aware of is that it\u2019s a 20 minute drive from Sapa and you have to get a taxi. Going into the town the homestay calls a lady to drive you and she charges 250,000 dong (quite a lot!). Coming back from Sapa to the homestay, we got a taxi on the meter for 200,000 dong, so slightly better. However, we ended up going in and out of town twice over the course of our stay so the cost of taxis really adds up. We spent more on taxis than the actual homestay itself!\n\nThe night was mostly very peaceful, but as you are in a village there are a lot of dogs so you can hear quite a bit of barking - as soon as

They also always provided us with tea, coffee and fruit, anytime we dropped into the space, it was always really great coffee too!\n\nMay Lai is such a kind and calm person to trek with, she totally tailors the experience to you, you can be as physically intense or as laidback as you like with the walking, and the scenery was unreal. Beautiful rice terraces, bamboo forests and tiny villages. People you come across are curious and friendly, when you smile or nod at them their faces light up.\nWe loved learning about the local plants from May Lai, which berries we can eat, which leaves are used for indigo dye, and more.\nWe saw no other foreigners the entire time. May Lai was so generous with letting us into her home and meeting her family, from having delicious lunch with her mum and cousins to staying the night in her lovely traditional wooden home and spending time with her curious and excitable daughter and shy and sweet son. The home cooked meals we had during this tour were all wonderful and my partner still finds herself thinking about them. We also had the special opportunity to buy some beautiful 2nd hand textiles handmade by her mother in years past. I cant wait to come back, and we will want stay so much longer next time!", "time": 1717111522, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Mattia Bernetti", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114587367149204937819/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIdndjTBhcK__j04aNhteTvJOVpk8s8A_KLxadZw46bOR_B5w=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "4 months ago", "text": "We did a two-days one-night trekking, and we will forever remember this as the highlight of our 2-weeks trip in Vietnam. All people at Ethos speak fluent English, including our guide My, and this was essential to get the most out of the experience. They are local Hmongs, so they could explain every little detail we were interested about, from their culture to management of the rice fields. The landscapes we went through were stunning, and there were no other tourists besides us. Every local family we visited during the hike has been incredibly kind and welcoming to us. We really experienced their everyday life in their own homes. The food was amazing, the best of our whole travel. We cooked together, including wild vegetables harvested along the way, and we made spring rolls. Way over our expectations. The price it is absolutely worth for such a unique experience. Furthermore, their work supports directly the local communities, which is extremely valuable. We will definitely recommend it to our friends.\nThanks so much for everything.\nMattia & Michela", "time": 1710054830, "translated": false}], "user_ratings_total": 246, "website": "http://www.ethosspirit.com/"}, "timestamp": "2024-08-05 14:38:54"}}
