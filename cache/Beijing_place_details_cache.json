Not a ton of people, semi restored, and a lift just in case you can't / don't want to climb. There is a nice town at the entrance but its pretty touristy. In that it was pretty much rebuilt for tourism. It can be a difficult part of the wall to get to but they recently started a bus that goes directly to Simatai from DongZhimen. It cost 48 CNY one way and is about 2 1/2 hours. The tricky part is finding where the bus is so you may have to ask around a bit. The times are limited so do your research. I also suggest you reserve your ticket online for the wall. The cost for the wall is only 40 CNY but those tickets are limited. There is another ticket that is 170 CNY that includes access to the little water town and the wall but I feel it's a bit of a rip off. Also, please note that the bus back to DongZhimen is also limited. When you get to the water town reserve a spot for the bus and be on time or it will leave you or give your seat to someone else. There are 3 different places for tickets. The parking lot has a ticket office (kinda) for the bus. This is the same place to store luggage. There is the main ticket office that is in a huge building by a water fountain. They only sell the combined tickets. If you walk past the fountain with it and the main building on your right you'll go through an archway (I think) there will be another ticket office there for tickets just for the wall.

Since its opening, it has received more than 4 million visitors from home and abroad, including the paramount leaders in China and dignitaries from more than 90 countries. The Beijing City Planning Hall is one of the best places to know the long history of Beijing, which showcases the great achievements of Beijing urban planning construction, as well as the future development. For example, because there used to be a height limit on the buildings in Beijing, so virtually there are very few skyscrapers in the city. The highest building in Beijing right now is only 330 meters high and located in CBD. A new building called China of Honor is being built in CBD now, which is going to be 528 meters in height in 2016. Visitors could see its model on the second floor of the Exhibition Hall.

When we took a taxi from the Forbidden City back to the hotel near Beijing Station at 4:30 pm on the first day, the driver enthusiastically talked about a lot of attractions in Beijing, among which \"Huguang Guild Hall\" was definitely a must-see, and looked disgusted as to why we hadn't heard of it. Go see old alleys, crosstalk performances, taste Beijing tea, and experience old Beijing. If you haven\u2019t been there, you\u2019ve come to Beijing in vain. Tickets are 160 all-inclusive. Today is the last day for the exhibition. If you don\u2019t go, you\u2019ll miss it. But we thought the tickets were too expensive and refused to go. Then the driver suggested that we take the subway and take us directly to a nearby subway station to drop us off because of the serious traffic jams on the road. We had no doubts. (It turns out that the driver doesn\u2019t want to take us, so we can quickly find the next driver)\nOn the second day, we took a taxi from the Temple of Heaven and returned to the hotel around 4:30 pm. This time, the driver explained that a foreign head of state was here, and traffic control was implemented outside, and cars could not drive through. He suggested that we play for a while longer. It was better to go back at 5:30 and the transportation was better (we believed it). We also recommended going to the Huguang Guild Hall. I kept saying that it was a must-go. I kept saying that I could learn more about and experience Beijing by seeing the old alleys, drinking tea, and riding rickshaws. Suddenly, I changed I was stupid (forgetting that the driver said it was the last day the day before yesterday, oh my god! I'm so stupid.), so I let the driver take me there.\n\nWhat is the legendary must-see old Beijing like? The answer is: The pit is huge.\nFirst I bought tickets for 160 per person, and then the waiter had a bad attitude. She explained the courtyard house for five minutes, then led us to listen to cross talk for five minutes, and then went to wait for the rickshaw outside. After waiting for almost ten minutes, more and more customers were waiting. Nearly 20 people were waiting in line for the bus. The bus finally arrived, and at the same time, Many rickshaws came to take us there together, so the rickshaws rode around the so-called old alleys for a few times, and got off in less than five minutes (getting off the bus was not at the same point as getting off the bus). Where is the so-called old Beijing? What about the alley? I didn't see anything! I feel cheated now. After we got off the bus, we walked to the alley opposite to see the works of famous calligraphers and painters they claimed. On the way, everyone complained that they felt cheated, only to find out that everyone was brought here by taxi, with a lot of excuses. It's quite popular. Some of the tickets for this museum usually cost 260 yuan. If there is a discount of 160 yuan, you can go in and see. Some of them recommend taking a rickshaw for an hour and explaining the old alley in detail. When we arrived at the so-called calligraphy exhibition, it was just a few calligraphy and paintings, and the introduction of a few calligraphers we didn\u2019t know. So we made a request to complain, but the attitude of the service staff was extremely bad and they rushed us to the next destination (teahouse). Half of us (about ten) refused to go and asked to return to the club to argue, and the other half followed us. Drive to the tea house. After we argued many times, the calligraphy shop employee took us back to the clubhouse. Oh my God! The guild hall turned out to be less than 300 meters away around the corner, but the rickshaw took me around for a few minutes. This is not a lie! Finally, when the staff couldn't stop us, we all walked into the lobby of the club together and asked to talk to the person in charge in the lobby.\nThe person in charge took us to the side and asked for a refund on the grounds that we were not satisfied with the service.", "time": 1529200400, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "tetsuya nakamura", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109748640801207573007/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ja", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVmq7TIMY0sjxZmbYw4K4hLXc6cklkiSO8Mit9vlZwPhQvtX9au5g=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "6 years ago", "text": "You can watch Peking Opera.

This site lies about 42 km south-west of Beijing and is at the juncture of the North China Plain and the Yanshan Mountains. Adequate water supplies and natural limestone caves in this area provided an optimal survival environment for early humans. Scientific work at the site is still under way. So far, ancient human fossils, cultural remains and animal fossils from 23 localities within the property dating from 5 million years ago to 10,000 years ago have been discovered by scientists. These include the remains of Homo erectus pekinensis, who lived in the Middle Pleistocene (700,000 to 200,000 years ago), archaic Homo sapiens of about 200,000\u2013100,000 years ago and Homo sapiens sapiens dating back to 30,000 years ago. At the same time, fossils of hundreds of animal species, over 100,000 pieces of stone tools and evidence (including hearths, ash deposits and burnt bones) of Peking Man using fire have been discovered.\n\nAs the site of significant hominid remains discovered in the Asian continent demonstrating an evolutionary cultural sequence, Zhoukoudian is of major importance within the worldwide context.
