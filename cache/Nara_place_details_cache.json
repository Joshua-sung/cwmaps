Some building are still under construction and it looks like Nara is trying to rebuild the lost palace of Heijo.

Almost a copy and record of Chinese tang dynasty. Some pseudo antique buildings like \u6731\u96c0\u95e8 \u592a\u6781\u95e8 are very impressive. There is even a replica ship demo (when Japan sent students to China to study abroad 1300 years ago). The park is full of feeling about history. The only issue which is really bugging is that the park is too big to walk to all attractions. Mission impossible especially in summer. The park should provide some rental bicycles service. Another big problem is that the whole park is cut through by Nara railway track. If you sit in front of Suzaku gate, you will un see the train running across the park almost every 5 minutes.\n\nBTW, there is a small coffee shop named IRACA, close to the tourist center. very yummy ice cream and special drinks & coffee.

Many of them can speak either Chinese or English which helps so so much! And yes, it's understandable. Not just the basic basic English kind.\n\nDefinitely come and check this place out, buy some of their stuff, check out the guided tours they have available and come stay here for a few nights. You can even cook in the kitchen if needed and relax for a while after a day of exploring! Learn to do some calligraphy, have a tea ceremony and wear/ take some pictures in kimonos/yutakas. Service is excellent. Prices are affordable. A few mins walk to a variety of food places and a nearby Starbucks. Plus receive many gifts while here. They do not serve breakfast here however.

This was early April, which meant cherry blossoms were on the trees, keep in mind that this is not true at other times of year...\n\nThey advise you to get there \"early\" but I got to the site 40 minutes early and ended up waiting alone for much of that, so take \"early\" to mean \"a few minutes early\", (a bus-ride is required, so I had limited options for when I could arrive, and erred on the side of caution, unnecessarily, as it turns out). Currently the tour starts in a residential area, gotten to by a fairly short bus ride from Nara train station, but that may change as the tour owner has his eyes on other more central locations.\n\nI'm a 49 year old, out-of-shape asthma sufferer, so I was a little trepidatious, but the uphill parts of the tour are at the beginning, thankfully, and were not too bad. Most were very gentle upward slopes that were no problem at all. Maybe 3, 4 times, I needed to get off my bicycle and walk a few minutes on a slightly steeper slope, along with a couple other folks who wanted to take a breather. The rest of the group waited patiently for us all, and the guide came partway back down the slope to give us assistance if we needed it, mainly moral support and the assurance that he wouldn't leave us behind.\n\nThe first part of the tour took us through/around one of Nara's larger shrine complexes, and to a shop which in the past, made katana for samurai, and still does make katana, but whose main product now is beautiful and exceptionally sharp knives using multi-folded steel. Then it was on, up to the highest of 3 crests on Wakakusayama, a small(ish) mountain which overlooks the entire city, and is clear of trees so that you can see for miles (or kilometers ;) ) We had a quick lunch (must bring your own food and drink. Don't forget to hydrate!!) at the top, and then a nice cycle, mostly downward, to an out-of-the-way waterfall, which was picturesque and cool in both senses of the word. Next we went to see the ruins of a small, old temple, but having been burned down (if my memory is correct) there was not really much to see there other than the foundation stones and a small Japanese style storage building. However this was on the way to our last point of interest, Japanese jizo (monk) carvings, protected from damage by an enclosure that made it impossible to get too close, but still a nice surprise out in an area away from the main crowd of people who come to Nara.\n\nAll in all, a pleasant day of exercise, seeing Nara's nature and some history, and of course, the deer :) . The guide told us what he could of the area, but it was more about getting away and seeing pretty sights without being crushed by a crowd, than about learning history, so I had no expectations on that front. He was friendly and courteous, and was careful to keep everyone together and safe. Helmets and UV cutting sunglasses are offered for those who wish to use them, and bicycles were chosen according to height and leg length, and were easily adjustable. He made sure we were each comfortable on the bikes, exchanging them with a different bike if we weren't, and giving us some time at the start to get used to them.\n\nI would gladly go again, or on one of their other tours of Nara that have a different focus. They offer a Nara craft beer tour as well, (no cycling for that one!) ;)", "time": 1620200838, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Francesco Petrini", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118414513340256810586/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVk8uCxQ1jkmqFXrCWpbMqSkchl_ndfjjUgtlK1m-_7sbAw15ow=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "12 months ago", "text": "What a blast!

Going from the trail entry to the hilltop takes about an hour, where you'll want to pause to enjoy the view, then another hour or so to get to the waterfall, and another hour and a half trek to the edge of the forest in the southwest.

I read somewhere that the trail around the forest is about 10km. And some visitors took up to 4 hrs. (We ended up taking more than 5 - excluding the time we took from Nara station to the start of the trail).\n\nWe set off from Nara station. There\u2019s a visitor centre above the station where we picked up a map.\n\nAnyway, once we reached Nara Park, we got lost after walking along what we thought was the way to the start of the trail.\n\nWe eventually found an entrance further inwards near Satei Yusui, a restaurant near the Mizuya Shrine. This was the Kasugayama Mountain Trail.\n\nThe trail was a pretty straightforward gravel path. It became an upslope climb for most of the way and let us to the top of Mount Kasuga. As we neared the top, we saw a sign to turn left to go to the mountain top, and turn right to continue on the trail.\n\nWe were glad to have headed to the mountain top. Apart from satisfying our curiosity of the view from the top, there was a toilet and a car park and some vending machines with cold and hot drinks. Good for a recharge.\n\nFrom the mountain top, there was an option to head down to Nara Park (nearer). Or to continue one round around the forest before returning to Nara Park (much much longer).\n\nWe decided to walk the long way, and realize there was a one-way narrow road for cars to drive into the forest. Although they have to pay a toll charge. On our walk, we didn\u2019t see any cars pass us by.\n\nThe trail goes down. Which was a relief as we had been walking up quite a bit before that. After awhile, we saw a sign pointing to a waterfall that was 600m away.\n\nSo we decided to go. When we heard no water sounds as we walked lower down the trail, we started dreading the thought of having to walk all the way back up. Thankfully, we found the waterfall and did hear the water sounds as we got nearer. This was the Uguisuno-taki falls.\n\nThankfully, we did not have to retrace our steps, and followed another trail back to the main route.\n\nApparently, you can drive to a car park nearby, and walk down to the waterfall. This is along the one-way route for cars into the forest. But this stop is a branch off the main road, which cars then have to get back onto.\n\nWith the sun about to set in less than 90 minutes, and us barely at the halfway point, we started to walk faster. Haha.\n\nWe eventually reached a security post. There was a trail that turned right just before the post that led down to the Takayama Shrine. We took this route as it looked like the shortest way out from the forest.\n\nAlong the way, the path split into one that led downwards to a rest stop. We decided to go with that one. The path was rocky and I think it\u2019s a shorter path that followed along the Noto River, compared to the trail we saw on the map that was more windy.\n\nThe trail ended and we exited to a small road that led down to houses along the street. We were back in town just before the sun set!\n\nSo here\u2019s our thoughts:\n\n- the forest is very nice and majestic.\n- You need to give yourself time to enjoy.\n- Good walking shoes is a must.\n- Limited toilets and rest stops along the trail.\n- There\u2019s probably other trails apart from the one we walked along.\n- We came across people who were either hiking or jogging.\n- Bring water.\n- The walk consist of upslopes and downslopes.\n- We missed some of the sights and shrines cos we were rushing a bit, and also at times feeling lost.\n- Just follow the main route and have your mobile phone with a data plan so you can track where you are along the trail.", "time": 1674836621, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Nathan Miller", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103746506488413848621/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUa0WE27Faj6gsmZEL37EypSZvD0uyDGt_YwSGS50wJoY4mfVpX=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "Tons of awesome hiking trails up and down the mountain, along with loads of excellent views along the way.

It's not a beach at all. The BBQ was still fun, but there was more to it than that.\nFirst, I made a reservation for the afternoon session. Initially, we were told to come with about 6 people, but we managed to make a reservation for 4 people. I remember being very happy at that time. When I bought the ingredients and went to the BBQ, I had to call someone at the reception desk and wait, but no one came, and I ended up waiting for about 18 minutes. The BBQ started with some hesitation, but it went surprisingly smoothly. (There are no explanations about BBQ procedures or equipment, so it may be unfriendly for beginners.)As I gradually started using it, I almost ran out of the plates and chopsticks that were provided at the beginning, so I went to get some more. I decided to do it. (By the way, I confirmed over the phone that I could get extra paper plates and disposable chopsticks.) Then a young woman came (she was sitting there playing a game) and I asked her if I wanted extra plates. You'll need extra money,'' I was told. I haven't heard of that. Even though I said what I said on the phone, they didn't listen to me at all. In the end, even though I was originally told to clean up from 8:30, I finished eating at around 8:00, and while I was putting together the garbage, I started cleaning up the stove while I was talking, ``I have some leftover marshmallows, how about roasting them?'' It was. I have been to many places where you can have BBQ, but this is my first time doing something like this. I couldn't make a sound because I was more surprised than angry. Last but not least, the price here is 1200 yen per person. It may seem cheap at first glance, but it costs 4,800 yen for 4 people and 7,200 yen for 6 people. So, in addition to the stove and binchotan charcoal, I was only given paper plates, scissors, and tongs. This is not cheap at all.
