The circuits use a think stainless steel rope strung from tree to tree upon which guests are attached by a rope to a harness which they climb into. There is also a secondary line attacked to carabineer clip which is largely  unnecessary but increases the fear. There are several zip lines one of which is 150m long for the finale. I anticipated that, in typical Japanese fashion, there would be loads of staff pandering to the fears of the guests but such is the thickness of the steel rope to which guests are threaded, once you are up in the trees you are on your own. I did not fall once, which in retrospect I think was a mistake. I should have deliberately jumped off one of the tree to tree tightropes so as to test the steel roped harness and convince myself of its safety.\n\nThe only thing that I thought might be dangerous is that the extra carabineer line that customers affix themselves might, in the case of young and inept person, get caught around their head causing them to be hung if they were to fall off. There is just one place where the harness is detached from the steel rope, at the Tarzan swing, at which point it is important not to panic. The nearby  park restaurant is also recommended for good food and lots of souvenirs.\n\nI only wish that there were more views, and one of these parks on a mountain looking down on Yamaguchi City.

After her demonstration, you get to cook your own okonomiyaki on a hotplate, with provided instructions.  Staff members were always around to provide guidance.\n\nAfter our class, we were taken on a tour of the Otafuku museum and factory.  The museum contained educational material about the start of Otafuku.  At the factory, we were able to see the various bottles being processed as well as the packaging and shipping area.  At the conclusion of the tour, we were all handed a bottle of Takoyaki sauce hot off the factory floor.\n\nAfter the class and tour, you are given the opportunity to purchase supplies for making your own dishes at their store.
