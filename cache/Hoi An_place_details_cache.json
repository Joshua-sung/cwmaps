There are sufficient seats and you can still see the whole spectacle by  sitting anywhere  regardless. The show is the money spinner for them judging by the crowd and ticket price. Its one hour long consisting of 5 acts depicting the rise of hoi an and its importance. Nice show with many performers and lights and they discouraged any photo taking during the performance. . While going back, the bridge is beautifully lit with myriad colours. The only drawback is this is the only  entry/ exit point and the small lane leading out to the main road is jam packed with tour buses waiting to pick up the tour groups. Its best if you can pre-arranged some transport home as getting a public transport at this hour is quite difficult.

We arranged for a return ride from klook ( 30usd return trip , 20 mins from city)  but you can easily get return transfer once you arrive at the hotels too as they are so many transport company.\nYou cannot bring food ( as they do check the bags ) but can bring baby food/special diet and plain water . Don't think there is a stroller rental so bring your own if with kids. There is a bicycle rental option if you are without kids .\nNon peak period , there is no line for any rides!  Everything under one roof . Doable to visit within a day but please take the buggy combo option( until 5.30pm only, may need to call hotline if no buggy at stop) as the park is super huge and will take time to walk .\nCome around 9.30 and start with river cruise at the Safari that will take around 35 minutes. There' s a professional photographer here where u can ask them to take ur family photo with your own phone too. The printed picture is around 100k Dong. You can feed the animals for 30k dong a cup. Good activity for kids .\nThen,  Take buggy to Adventure land and if u have baby and  toddler can start with a few kiddy rides ( like the boat, small ship, round swing, spinning teacup,  first in adventure land . ( there's min height each ride please check website) .\nIf it is too hot can stop by at the indoor park with air-conditioning ( trampoline , slides, blocks, Free arcade games!!) . There's a comfortable air cond cafe ( only donuts and drinks) here but you can buy take away snacks (french fires, fish ball,sausage)  from the restaurants outside  beside the bbq korean restaurant.\nYou can continue the adult rides in adventure land .( crazy ones is available too!!!)  Then visit the 4D Castle for a 15 minutes show every half hour showtime.\nWe didn't visit the folk culture area but you can do so as it is already near the castle.  There are also cultural show timing so please find it out. We went to the waterpark after but please keep in mind it closes at 5.30 and locker key and towels need to be returned on time if not you will not get your deposit !\nThere is an immersive art 3D show at the hills of mountains at 6.15pm for 15 mins show and make your way to the 30 minutes fountain show starts at 6.40pm.

This one star is for their character, because I really felt good when dealing with them. However, here comes the negative part. I chose this tailor place based on a recommendation. I wanted to get a bikini for surfing - modern looking but sportsy and practical for water sports. I had prepared pictures of my dream model, unfortunately, I was told that this tailor can't do it exactly as I wished. I was okay with it and agreed on how the swimsuit can be made with adjustments. The model was two-layered, with high-waisted bottom and sports-bra-like top with crossed straps in the back.\n\nI wanted my swimsuit to be made of 3 different colours (for both top and bottom part), but this was not possible either. Therefore, I chose two final colours - a light pink and a darker magenta. Also, the tailor suggested using higher quality material which is stronger but also more expensive. Since I wanted this piece of bikini to be really practical for surfing, I agreed with using the better material.\n\nAfter placing the order at the tailor shop and paying the total price of $70, it took 1 day to prepare the first version of the bikini. The top was too loose, so it needed to be adjusted. I thought that the bottom part was okay, it fitted nicely when I tried it on. It took 8 hours more to adjust the top part of the bikini. When I tried it for the second time, it fitted much better and I thought no more adjustments were needed. I took my new bikini home.\n\nAt home, I realised there was a lot of unfinished work left on the swimsuit - for example, threads were sticking out of the swimsuit, padding on one side was sewn but not on the other, blue tailor's chalk was visible on the swimsuit, excess pieces of fabric were left hanging on the top of the swimsuit.  Honestly, I didn't notice these apparent details in the store, and that's why I didn't address them right away.  Only at home, in peace, with plenty of time, did I realize this and felt the first disappointment.\n\nAlthough I felt a bit uneasy, I went on and tried the bikini for surfing as I was excited to see how it would perform in action. When the swimsuit got wet in the sea, I started to feel that the bottom part of the bikini is getting too loose. Not that it would completely fall down with the first wave, but it didn't stay in one place. Even when I got out of the water and just walked on the beach, I could feel how loose it was in the back. The fabric wasn't stretched, on the contrary, it gathered downwards and it's just not what it looks like.  Of course, you could say that I tried the swimsuit on and it fit me, so it's not the fault of the seamstress that it doesn't fit so well in water (or after getting wet).  However, I think an experienced seamstress would be able to advise me that I need a tighter fit for my particular type of fabric and cut when dry.  So I see it at least partly as a fault of the tailor who could not give good advice and estimate the result. I was a bit sad about it, but at the same time I blamed myself.\n\nHowever, when I came back home after 1 hour of surfing, the real disappointment came. I noticed steaming seams in two places - on the top and bottom of the swimsuit. And when I gently handwashed the bikini, I could see the heavily coloured pink water flowing from it. Well, I am not a swimsuit expert, but I think that high quality material should not release so much colour. Most importantly, a tailor made swimsuit for $70 should not get loose and broken seams after 1 use.\n\nWhen I summarised it in my head, I felt upset and strongly disappointed by the whole product and the state and quality in which it was delivered. I am sad about it as the owner of this tailor shop seemed so nice, but I now conclude the product I got was super overpriced and low quality. I am not in Hoi An to come and deal with it in person anymore.
