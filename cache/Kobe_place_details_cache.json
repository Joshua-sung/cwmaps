With its remarkable beauty and tranquil surroundings, this waterfall provided a perfect resting spot before my mountain climbing adventure. I would rate it 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nFirst and foremost, the waterfall itself is undeniably beautiful. As the water cascades down the rocky cliffs, it creates a mesmerizing display of nature\u2019s power and elegance. The sight of the crystal-clear water falling gracefully into the pool below is truly a sight to behold. I found myself captivated by the rhythmic sound of the flowing water, which added to the overall serenity of the place.\n\nMoreover, the location of the waterfall is strategically positioned as a convenient resting point before embarking on a mountain climbing expedition. The surrounding area provides ample space to relax and rejuvenate, allowing visitors to recharge their energy for the upcoming hike. Sitting by the waterfall, I felt a sense of tranquility washing over me, providing the perfect opportunity to pause, reflect, and prepare for the adventure ahead.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was the ability to enjoy the waterfall while taking a break. There are designated areas near the waterfall where visitors can sit, rest, and soak in the breathtaking view. It was a wonderful experience to find a comfortable spot, breathe in the fresh air, and bask in the mesmerizing beauty of the cascading water. This combination of relaxation and natural beauty created a serene atmosphere that made the visit truly memorable.\n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed my time at \u5e03\u5f15 waterfall, there is one aspect that could be improved. The accessibility to the waterfall could be enhanced with clearer signage or directions, as it took a bit of effort to find the exact location. However, once I arrived, the experience more than made up for the initial challenge.\n\nIn conclusion, \u5e03\u5f15 waterfall is a truly remarkable destination, offering a tranquil and picturesque respite for nature enthusiasts and adventurers alike. Its stunning beauty, combined with its convenient location as a resting point before climbing the nearby mountain, makes it a worthwhile visit. Despite minor navigation difficulties, I rate this waterfall 4 out of 5 stars for its serene ambiance and remarkable natural splendor.", "time": 1689565457, "translated": false}, {"author_name": "Achmad Januar Er Putra", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108773894600163003789/reviews", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUACdD_Z4cylbpELTBaJDimS1ZH7_9ez9pzqlVoG-e30YlMH3K7=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "One of the chain of Nunobiki waterfalls.

Even though it's relatively small in size, after two hours of wandering around with beautiful animals passing by with nothing separating us, we didn't want to leave!\n\nWe were so surprised that all the animals looked happy, clean, and were very active. They even seemed to love posing for pictures! My artistic instincts drew inspiration from the animals. They demonstrated pure happiness, kindness and love for each other. Two pink flamingos were the highlight of the day, as the couple posed together to form a heart shape.\n\nI wonder how the staff treats the animals to keep them happy and contented in their little kingdom?

This famous place is located between the Minato and Motomachi downtown areas of Kobe. (The hotel you can see behind me in the photo is Hotel Okura, and Motomachi is just down the street in front of you towards the mountain (Mt. Rokko).)\n\u25bc ``These days, I became a disciple of the military scholar Katsuraintaro Daisensei, and he was loved by me...I put on a slightly arrogant face and secretly asked him to come.Ahem, ahem,'' he wrote a humorous letter to his sister. Ryoma Sakamoto, who sent the training center, will go out of his way to raise funds for the establishment of this training center.\n\u25bcAs stated in the letter, the idea was Kaishu Katsu, a high-ranking official of the shogunate at the time. Kaishu took the 14th Shogun, Iemochi Tokugawa, on board the warship Jundomaru, explained the need for a navy, and obtained permission to open the Kobe Naval Training Center.\n\u25bcHowever, the money donated by the shogunate was not enough to cover the operation of the training center, so Ryoma was able to open it by borrowing 1,000 ryo from Shungaku Matsudaira of the Fukui clan.\n\u25bcIt seems that the ``ahem, ahem'' letter I mentioned earlier was written right after this construction was completed, but even though Ryoma was just a ronin, he was truly a man with great mediation skills.\n\u25bcThis naval training center was opened by Kaishu Katsu as its director for the purpose of operating the Kanrin Maru, a warship of the Shogunate. Kaishu Katsu was also an interesting person, and in this small fishing village, he would like to thank the people who took care of him. ``The Shogunate will succumb to external pressure, and Kobe will eventually open a port in this area. Buy the land now,'' he said, a statement that could hardly be believed to be from an important member of the Shogunate. Those who actually bought the land ended up making a lot of money (lol).\n\u25bcFurthermore, although they were important members of the shogunate, they also attracted many anti-shogunate patriots. Well, you can see it by looking at the way he has faith in Ryoma Sakamoto.\n\u25bcWhen the ``Kinmon Incident'' broke out in Kyoto, the shogunate saw the fact that there were many anti-shogunate patriots as a problem and closed the training center. Kaishu Katsu was dismissed from office, and Ryoma and others were sheltered by the Satsuma clan.\n\u25bcThen, Ryoma made use of his experience at this training center and established Kameyama Shachu in Nagasaki with funding from Satsuma Domain's Tomoatsu Godai and others. As you all know, this would develop into the famous Kaientai.\n\u25bcIt\u2019s the remains of a huge dream! Kaishu Katsu, Ryoma Sakamoto, and others at the end of the Edo period.

Later, they funded the anti-Qing movement in their home country and also made great contributions to Sun Yat-sen\u2019s Revolution of 1911. This was Sun Yat-sen's base camp in Japan at that time. The Kobe branch of the Chinese Kuomintang had a great influence. Interestingly, Sun Yat-sen also appointed a Kobe Chinese as the Minister of Transportation. During the Sino-Japanese War, the number of Chinese was greatly reduced, and the Chinese in Japan had to endure the discriminatory policies in the war environment. At that time, the overseas Chinese in Fujian even staged an uprising. Most of the collections are overseas Chinese calligraphy and paintings, and one is by Kang Youwei. There are also some old items from the Kuomintang, such as overseas party membership certificates and government approval documents. When Taiwan returned to China in 1945, there were also Taiwanese Japanese who applied for Chinese passport approval. This is a very precious historical material.\n\nAfter the war, it can be seen from the introduction of the museum that the Chinese in Kobe were also divided into two factions, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The schools of the two sides also taught different things. In 1953, there was an incident of overseas Chinese returning to the mainland. I wonder whether these overseas Chinese will be fine after returning. ?\n\nAccording to the museum staff, you can visit the Sun Wen Museum by taking the subway for about five stops from Kobe Station to \"Maiko\" station and then walking for five minutes.

Afterwards, Arioka Castle fell, and although they continued their resistance from Hanakuma Castle after passing through Amagasaki, the castle fell to Tsuneoki Ikeda of the Oda side in 1580. Although it is a mock-up, the castle is equipped with stone walls known as anato-zumi, which was a state-of-the-art technology from the Sengoku to Azuchi-Momoyama periods, and shows us that Kobe was an advanced region even back then.

On the top floor, you can see the inside of this Houndstooth Gable during this special Himeji Castle exhibition.\n\n*Himeji Castle, Himeji domain history.\n\u30fbDuring the Ikeda period, Terumasa Ikeda of Mikawa Province (present-day Aichi Prefecture) and Yoshida Domain (present-day Toyohashi City, Aichi Prefecture), who had 150,000 koku, entered Himeji with 520,000 koku in Harima Province due to his military exploits at the Battle of Sekigahara. .\nHow did Lord Terumasa suddenly become the lord of such a large domain? It is true that he was credited with the battle of Sekigahara, but the main reason was that he had a connection with Tokuhime (widow of Ujinao Hojo), the beloved daughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu, who became his second wife. Lord Terumasa gave the Himeji domain to his eldest son Toshitaka, 280,000 koku of Okayama domain in Bizen (present-day Okayama prefecture) to his second wife Tokitaka and his own son Tadatsugu, and 60,000 koku of Awaji province to his third son Tadao, and to Terumasa's younger brother Nagayoshi. The Ikeda family had ties to the Tokugawa family, with the Tottori domain in Inaba (present-day Tottori Prefecture) as its territory, and the family owned more than 1 million koku of territory throughout the Kinai region. Furthermore, as befits the Ikeda family of the Himeji domain, which is a prestigious domain, it was Himeji that had the equivalent of 104,000 koku, which is 20% of the 520,000 koku table, and achieved a fiercely harsh government, raising the total power of the country and building a castle. It will be.\n\nUnder the One Country, One Castle Order, it was not treated as a castle, but as a castle or a dome, and the territory included Miki Castle with 37,000 koku of land, Toshimasa Ikeda with Akashi Castle (fleet castle) with 5,000 koku, and Takasago Castle with Nakamura Shudonosuke. Masakatsu placed 10,000 koku for Narifusa Arao at Tatsuno Castle (Kikagoyama Castle), 32,000 koku for Yoshiyuki Ikeda at Hirafuku Castle (Rigami Castle), and 32,000 koku for Nagamasa Ikeda at Ako Castle (Kariya Castle).\n\nWhen Ikeda Terumasa died in 1613, his second son Tadao was given the equivalent of 130,000 koku of land in western Harima, making the Okayama domain worth 390,000 koku.\n(The branch family already had 20,000 koku.) In 1617, when Toshitaka Ikeda, the second lord of the domain, died at the young age of 33, Toshitaka's eldest son Mitsumasa became the lord of the domain at the age of 3, but he was not a young prince. Because Himeji, which was a strategic location, could not be left in charge, he was transferred to Inaba Tottori for 320,000 koku.\n\n* Terumasa Ikeda\nHe was born in Seishu, Owari Province (present-day Aichi Prefecture) as the second son of Tsuneoki Ikeda, a senior vassal of Lord Nobunaga Oda. He became a Genpuku and took the name Terumasa. In 1573, he was adopted by Yoshihisa Arao, his maternal uncle, and became the lord of Kida Castle. His first battle was at the Battle of Arioka Castle, where Araki Murashige and his son rebelled against Lord Oda Nobunaga. In 1580, at the Battle of Hanakuma Castle, he took up his position on Kita-Suwagamine and defeated five or six people, achieving great fame. In 1582, he went to battle against Koshu. After Lord Nobunaga was defeated by Mitsuhide Akechi in the Honnoji Incident, Hideyoshi Hashiba arrived at Amagasaki after attacking the Chugoku region, and joined Terumasa's father, Tsuneoki Ikeda. It was promised that Hideyoshi's nephew Hidetsugu would be Tsuneoki's son-in-law, and that Terumasa would be adopted by Lord Hideyoshi, and Tsuneoki became the lord of Ogaki Castle in Mino Province (present-day Gifu Prefecture), but the relationship between Lord Hideyoshi and Lord Ieyasu After his father and older brother were killed in the battle of Komaki and Nagakute, he inherited Mino Ogaki with 130,000 koku. Afterwards, he became the lord of Gifu Castle. He served in the conquest of Kishu, the campaign of Toyama (Sassa Narimasa conquest), and the pacification of Kyushu, and in 1587, in recognition of his military merits and achievements, he was given the surname Hashiba and Toyotomi.\nIn 1590, he participated in the Odawara conquest and Oshu attack. As a result of his military exploits, Mikawa Yoshida was awarded 152,000 koku. Around the same time, Hidetsugu TOYOTOMI also entered Owari, and it is said that Terumasa himself entered the neighboring country with Hidetsugu.\n\nHe did not participate in the Bunroku War (dispatch of troops to Korea), but became Hidetsugu's close apprentice in Japan and assumed the post of Togoku Keigo.\nHe indirectly participated in the Bunroku War, and was involved in supplying food and rice to Nagoya Castle, the front-line base for the Bunroku War, and building large warships. He was also involved in the construction of Fushimi Castle and Tanai Castle, and through the mediation of Lord Hideyoshi, he adopted Tokugawa Ieyasu's beloved daughter Tokuhime as his second wife. Although he already had a legal wife, Itohime (of the Nakagawa family), the relationship between Itohime and the Tokuhime was good. After this, through the mediation of Hidenari Nakagawa, he swore loyalty to Lord Tokugawa Ieyasu before the Battle of Sekigahara.\n\nIn 1595, when Kanpaku Toyotomi Hidetsugu fell from power, many of his wives and concubines were killed, but Terumasa's younger sister, Wakamandokoro, was spared as an exception and treated with special care. be treated. During the Toyotomi era, Lord Terumasa was treated like a member of the Toyotomi clan.\n\nAfter the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1598, the civilian faction led by Ishida Mitsunari and the militant faction led by Masanori Fukushima and Kiyomasa Kato clashed. Lord Terumasa, together with the militant faction, commits the Ishida Mitsunari attack.\nIn the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, although he did not go directly to Sekigahara, he participated in the attack by Hidenobu Oda (grandson of Nobunaga) on the side of the western army defending Gifu Castle, and occupied Mino (Gifu) country. Furthermore, it will facilitate control and guarantee the protection and safety of the people within Mino.\nIn the main battle, he will be responsible for holding back the forces of Hidemoto Mori and Hiroie Yoshikawa.

Chiyukitaka became the 8th highest rank among feudal lords in Japan, and was the first person outside of the Tokugawa clan to become a major general of the Ukonoe (Junior Fourth Rank).\n\nFrom 1601 to 1609, Himeji Castle and the castle town underwent large-scale renovations, and at the same time, river improvement and development projects were carried out in the Kako River basin, upstream areas of the Kako River, and Takagawa River, as well as river improvements in the downstream area.

In 1987, he became the first person other than a daimyo from the Tokugawa clan to become a junior third rank councilor. At the same time, he was allowed to use the surname Matsudaira. Prime Minister Matsudaira Harima and the people began to talk about this. The family owned more than 1 million koku and had a lot of status, making the foundation of the Ikeda family's prosperity solid until the Meiji period.\nIn January of the same year, he contracted paralysis and was hospitalized. The second Tokugawa shogun, Hidetada, sent four letters of sympathy to Terumasa's eldest son, Toshitaka. In August of the same year, he recovered and was promoted to Junior Third Rank Councillor, and expressed his gratitude to Lord Hidetada at Edo Castle for the surname Matsudaira.\nAfter that, he returned to Himeji, but became paralyzed again and died at the age of 50. Upon hearing of Terumasa's death, Toyotomi Hideyori and senior retainers of the Toyotomi family were shocked and mourned his death.\n\nIn the Meiji period, he was given the second rank of second rank.\n\n*At the Nishinomaru ruins, we will introduce the history of the Honda family, the next lords of the domain after the Ikeda family.

Visitors can spend hours gazing up at the heavens, picking out constellations, and marveling at the beauty and vastness of the cosmos.\n\nIn addition to stargazing, Kikuseidai also offers opportunities for relaxation and reflection, with benches and seating areas where visitors can sit back, unwind, and soak in the tranquil ambiance of the mountain surroundings.
