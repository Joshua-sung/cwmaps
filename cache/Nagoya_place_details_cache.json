for five years until 1920.\n\nThere was a library with a large collection of books, a daily newspaper was published, and the playground had various facilities such as football, tennis, gymnastics, and an orchestra, making it an open space.\n\nIt was rare for so many Germans to live in Nagoya, so the local residents treated them as if they were guests from afar, and were interested in the culture of Germany, a developed country, and had many interactions with them.\n\nThe residents of Mifukuro were particularly impressed by the hard-working lifestyle of the German people, learned a lot from their excellent vocational skills, used this knowledge to promote local industry, and deepened their friendships through music and sports.\n\nTherefore, I believe that erecting a monument at this site and conveying the facts of history to future generations is truly meaningful and a measure of international friendship.\n\nMarch 2003\nHonorary Chair of the Federal Republic of Germany in Nagoya Kohei

1982, with permission from Atsuta Shrine, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Nagoya Optical Cooperative Association.\n\nThe original shading clay figurine was excavated from the Tsugaru City wooden Kamegaoka ruins, which is owned by the Tokyo National Museum, and is designated as an important cultural property.\nIt is a large hollow clay figurine, and almost its entire shape can be seen except for the missing right leg. The legs are short, the waist is strongly bulging, and the torso has an arabesque-like curved pattern all over. The eyes are large ovals with a single horizontal line drawn in the shape of a so-called ``shade'', and the head has a complex crown-like decoration. This is an excellent piece that shows the advanced craft techniques achieved by Kamegaoka culture. Although it has a deformed shape overall, the presence of breasts indicates that, like most other clay figurines, it is a representation of a woman.\nThis clay figurine was excavated in April 1887, and introduced to the newly formed central academic society in October of the same year.

When I entered the venue, there was no guidance and I didn't know right away.\nI recommend finding the 0-year-old side and looking at them in age order from there. (However, it was unfortunate that the distance between the pillars was so narrow that people looking at other pillars would collide with each other. There is nothing that can be done about this.) After that, I thought it would be a good idea to look back at the work along the outer periphery. Or vice versa.\n\nI think people who didn't understand the flow looked at the display on the wall and got confused, looking at only one side of the chronology inside and then going back.\n\n*However, once you decide on the order, that's it.\nIt might be crowded\n\nAlso, I was very happy to be able to watch Mr. Wada's video, but unfortunately there were monitors in the noisy 4th exhibition room, so it was difficult to hear the audio, and there were two monitors, so the audio could be heard from the front and the right. It also felt strange coming. The same goes for the monitor in the lobby.

After Ieyasu's death, the library began with approximately 3,000 copies of Sunpu's books handed down to his son Yoshinao, and with successive feudal lords adding to the collection, the library currently has approximately 110,000 books. Before the war, it was located in Tokyo, but after the war it was moved back to its hometown of Nagoya, and now it is under the jurisdiction of Nagoya City thanks to a donation from the Tokugawa family. In the reading room, you can see printed copies of classics such as Kinjo Onkoroku and Parrot Chuuki.\nIn the entrance hall, a video called ``Digital Bunko'' introduces masterpieces from Hoza Bunko. There are 13 programs in total, and it will take about 90 minutes to watch them all, but there are many interesting contents such as ``Suruga Goshobon (Tokugawa Ieyasu's collection)'' and ``History of Hosa Bunko'', so If you have time, please check it out.\nIn addition to paper books, Hoza Bunko also produces and sells digital versions of the Nagoya Series. The first one is ``Kinjo Onkoroku''. The second edition is the diary of Genroku Tatami Magistrate Asahi Bunzaemon Shigeaki, ``Paromeme Chuuki.''\n\nI went to see the special exhibition ``Master! Appraisal of Edo''. ``The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter'' was displayed at the entrance of the venue, so I thought it was a fake manuscript of ``The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter'', but it was not so.It was to introduce the story related to the first forgery depicted in the story. . In ``The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter'', Princess Kaguya requests one of her suitors, ``Kuramochi no Oji'', to fetch ``H\u014drai's jade branch.'' In response, the prince orders a craftsman to make a branch of Horai's jewel, in an attempt to deceive Princess Kaguya. The plan was about to succeed, but something unexpected happened and the prince's lies were discovered. In a book I read a while ago, it was written that the ``Kuramochi no Oji'' depicted here was a satire of a real-life politician from the Asuka period. Who is that? If you are interested, please check it out. The name \"Kuramochi no Oji\" is a hint. I wrote a long article about something that has nothing to do with the exhibition. The introduction was so excellent that I couldn't help but want to write about it. Not bad.\nAside from that, I think this exhibition was more interesting than the exhibits themselves because of the various anecdotes surrounding the appraisals. Prices began to be attached to works of art from around the Muromachi period, and the authenticity of works of art became uncertain depending on the era.In addition, in the last corner of ``Appraisal in a difficult situation'', ``Appraisal should be strict, but appraisal The difficult part of appraisal is that the person receiving the appraisal expects a lenient appraisal.'' This has not changed since then.\n2023.629\n\nI went to see the special exhibition ``The World of Noh: Gods, Men, Women, Madness, Demons''. As the title suggests, this is an exhibition about Noh, including explanations of Noh programs, Noh masks, Noh costumes, props, and musical instruments. I had never seen a Noh performance before, but I learned a lot about Noh and found it very interesting.\nThere was a detailed explanation about Noh in the entrance. As always, photography of exhibits is prohibited, but unfortunately photography was also prohibited for this explanation. I wanted to take a photo of it because it explained Noh in detail, but I think that if this booklet had been sold as a booklet, people's understanding of Noh would have deepened considerably, but it was a shame that it wasn't there. .\n2023.4.18\n\nI went to see the special exhibition \"Tokugawa Bunbo Haku.\" This time too, the exhibition was limited to Hosa Bunko, but it was very interesting. ``Bunbo'' originally meant ``a cell or government office in charge of documents in the imperial court,'' but also ``a literary person's study.'' The tools used there are called \"stationery.\" Among them, inkstones, brushes, ink, and paper are called the ``Four Treasures of Bunbo,'' and have been particularly contrasted with Shohen. It was very interesting to be able to see many masterpieces of stationery owned by the Tokugawa Art Museum. By the way, the Tokugawa Museum of Art owns about 500 ancient ink paintings, which is said to be a world-class collection. That's surprising!\nI didn't have an illustrated catalog this time either, but I wish I had made one if possible.\n2023.1.26\n\nI went to see the special exhibition \"Falconry\". This special exhibition is only available at Hosa Bunko.\nEven though I was ignorant, I knew that falconry is a type of hunting that uses a falcon, but I didn't know the details at all. However, it was interesting to learn a lot about falconry at this exhibition.\nIn addition to exhibiting works of art related to falconry, Mr. Gomakichi, who is still active as a falconer, will be exhibiting stories such as ``Hawks are very delicate and timid,'' ``They are so sensitive that they can die from stress,'' and ``They are very close to humans.'' It was very interesting to hear about the ecology of hawks, which you can't imagine from their appearance. It's a pity that there is no illustrated catalog for such an interesting exhibit. I wish they had made it, even if it was just a booklet.\nThe exhibit also included an explanation about the difference between a hawk and an eagle. I've been having this problem since I was a kid, and this has finally solved it! If you want to know the difference between a hawk and an eagle, please come to the venue!\n2022.11.23\n\nI went to see the autumn special exhibition ``Specialties - Treasures with a timely history.'' The venue is both Hosa Bunko and Tokugawa Art Museum, but Hosa Bunko has famous swords on display. It seems that the origin of the specialty is that special names were given to excellent vessels in ancient times, which is interesting. Also on display at the venue are swords called ``Yakimono'' and ``Yakimi'' that have been reheated after being set on fire. If these were prized, does this mean that they valued not only the sword's creator or its artistic value, but also its history?\n2022.10.20\n\nI saw the special exhibition \"The World of Festivals: Elegance and Costumes.\" Since I went there twice, I was able to see both the ``Toyokuni Festival Folding Screen'' and the ``Nagoya Toshogu Festival Folding Screen.'' Needless to say, the Toyokuni Festival is a festival of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\nLately, it feels like Hideyoshi's loneliness and impatience in his later years have been emphasized, but looking at the enthusiasm of the people depicted on this folding screen, I wonder if that was actually true. I will. Of course, people at the time may have just wanted to make a fuss to vent their daily frustrations, regardless of Hideyoshi's evaluation.\nIn any case, it's a good idea to hold this exhibition at this time of year when the Domatsuri festival is held in Nagoya.\n2022.8.30", "time": 1688095006, "translated": true}, {"author_name": "\u8d64\u5742\u307f\u3064\u3051", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113717945885315397252/reviews", "language": "en-US", "original_language": "ja", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIT6-ltQ0lnl4DgZ2rPv2rEUw55iqcdanwmm9pQDTQZw2bdyg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "Basically, it is a free facility.\n\nIt has a collection of books related to the Owari Tokugawa family, which can be viewed by making a reservation.\n\nOn the right side as you enter, there is an information corner for events in Aichi Prefecture.

The surrounding area was once a hunting ground for the Owari Tokugawa family, and is now known as a visiting place for migratory birds.\nIn the past, the name was inconsistently written as ``Makiike,'' ``Makioike,'' ``Makinooike,'' and ``Makinoike,'' but in the Taisho period, the name was unified as ``Makinoike.'' However, when the city planning was decided in 1940, the surrounding area was incorrectly written as ``Makinogaike Green Area,'' and when it was turned into a park by the prefecture, that name was carried over, resulting in ``Makinogaike'' and ``Makinogaike.'' Various expressions have been used, including ``Noike''.\nThe local school district and Meito Ward appealed to the prefecture and city to return to the original name, and in July 2009, the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan asked the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan to revise the name of the pond, and the name was officially changed to ``Makino Pond.''
